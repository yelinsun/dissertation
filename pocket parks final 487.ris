AB  - Perched on the edge and corner of the city center, pocket parks transform urban vacant land into vibrant urban oases. It can greatly shorten the distance from citizens to the park, thereby promoting citizens' participation in outdoor activities and improving urban vitality. The construction of pocket parks in China started late. However, it has developed rapidly in recent years, which supports urban regeneration. A government document, published by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People’s Republic of China in 2002, promotes the construction of pocket parks. In the process of promoting the construction of pocket parks in Chinese cities, problems such as unclear construction standards, difficult operation and maintenance, blind copying, and emphasis on the landscape over the function have emerged. The aforementioned issues are elaborated and corresponding suggestions are pointed out in this short communication.

AB  - Purpose.
To assess the use of new pocket parks in low-income neighborhoods.
Design.
The design of the study was a quasi-experimental post-test only comparison.
Setting.
Los Angeles, California, was the setting for the study.
Subjects.
Subjects were park users and residents living within .5 mile of three pocket parks and 15 neighborhood parks.
Intervention.
The creation of pocket parks.
Measures.
We used the System of Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) tool to measure park use and park-based physical activity, and then surveyed park users and residents about their park use.
Analysis.
We surveyed 392 and 432 household members within .5 mile of the three pocket parks before and after park construction, respectively, as well as 71 pocket park users, and compared them to 992 neighborhood park users and 342 residents living within .5 mile of other neighborhood parks. We compared pocket park use to playground area use in the larger neighborhood parks. We used descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations for the analysis.
Results.
Overall, pocket park use compared favorably in promoting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with that of existing playground space in nearby parks, and they were cost-effective at $0.73/MET hour (metabolic equivalent hour) gained. Pocket park visitors walked an average of .25 miles to get to a park.
Conclusions.
Pocket parks, when perceived as attractive and safe destinations, may increase physical activity by encouraging families with children to walk there. Additional strategies and programs may be needed to encourage more residents to use these parks.

TI  - The Impact of a Child-Friendly Design on Children’s Activities in Urban Community Pocket Parks
AU  - Zhang, Le

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Urbanization is a global trend that is expected to continue, and by 2025, it is estimated that almost 60% of the world’s children will live in urban areas. Urban community pocket parks provide a solution to the need for parks in high-density urban communities due to their flexible location, small size, and patchy distribution. This paper aims to examine and optimize the construction of urban community pocket parks from a child’s perspective to encourage children’s participation in these parks. The first step was to conduct a literature review to identify key evaluation indicators for assessing the child-friendliness of pocket parks. Then, the AHP-entropy TOPSIS approach was used to establish an indicator system to effectively evaluate the child-friendliness of pocket parks in urban communities. The system included physical space, cognitive ability, emotional development, environmental perception, and social interaction. Finally, suggestions for optimization were made based on the weighting of influencing factors. The results show that freedom of movement (6.2%) significantly affects the child-friendliness ratings of community pocket parks. Additionally, Hefei residents are not sufficiently influenced by the diversity of play (2.29%) and play facility planning (2.58%) in pocket parks. Therefore, consideration should be given to focusing on the degree of nature adaptation in park construction and renewal projects, as well as understanding children’s perception of nature.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - While the focus of the wide-spread coronavirus is its impacts on people’s lives and economic wellbeing around the world, the pandemic substantially limits people’s available options of physical activities and exacerbates an enduring problem of large urban populations lack accessible green space to fulfill the essential physical and mental health needs. Under the current pandemic situation available green space is further reduced when some parks are closed or open with limited functions to reduce the spread of coronavirus. At the same time, the demand for green space has increased because of the unavailability of other activities. In this essay, we call the attention of urban planners and designers to pocket parks. Studies have shown that the tiny size of pocket parks makes them an easier fit into vacant properties scattered throughout the urban fabric. Therefore, pocket parks can improve health and encourage social cohesion of residents in often underserved high density urban neighborhoods. The potential of pocket parks in providing accessible urban green space to all urban population may have been considered desirable before the coronavirus outbreak and now it should be considered a necessary ‘lifeline’ to improve urban residents’ health during the coronavirus. In addition, with the long-overlooked value of accessible urban green space waken by the global-scale crisis, proper attention and improvement strategy, such as introducing more pocket park could lead to a better future after the COVID-19.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - This paper presents a summary of empirical evidence drawn from a literature review on the factors contributing to people using the pocket parks. Initial findings indicate that pocket parks play a significant role by providing access to nature for individuals living in urban areas. This paper provides an evidence-based approach to the usage and benefits of pocket parks by applying the SE-Model approach. This review includes 15 papers on pocket parks, obtained from electronic journal databases such as Scopus, Science Direct, Springer Link, SAGE Journals and Google Scholar sort by relevance containing key words such as pocket parks, vest-pocket parks, small public urban green space, small urban parks, use as well as usage of pocket parks. Selection was restricted to peer-reviewed publications related to pocket parks usage. The authors analysed these literatures for its sample characteristics, data collection, sampling method, data analysis and the main study finding. This review reveals an increase in research on the usage of pocket parks published in peer-reviewed journals in the recent years and a strong geographic bias. The selected studies have consistently reported on the importance of pocket parks for mental well-being, predominantly, followed by social benefits, however limited study approached the potential of pocket parks for physical activities. Physical components (green ground cover, bushes, trees, flower beds, water features) and Perceived Environment (preference for greener view; calm atmosphere; safety) are mostly reported to be highly associated with human health.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - Despite the focus on (large parks) green public spaces in urban areas, mini-parks have been disregarded, especially the way they should be designed based on people’s aesthetic preferences, in order to fulfill societal potential. Having used 25 computer-generated pocket park (PP) scenes with various levels of enclosure based on planting, this study seeks to investigate public opinion on three factors: coherence, legibility, and the refuge. Since vacant lands inherently receive limited budgets, design practices must develop innovative ways to implement the projects. Residents from Tehran, Iran (n = 318) participated in a visual online questionnaire depicting five main types for the permeability of enclosure in small leftover spaces, which had the possibility to change into PP. They were asked to assess the coherence, legibility, refuge, and select the types of activities they could imagine in each park. This study adopted a descriptive-analytical method. The results were evaluated using the chi-square test and are as follows: (1) In terms of all five types, participants rated the lowest for refuge in visually open and physically open scenes. (2) If the visual and physical scenes are enclosed, participants perceive the legibility to be higher compared to open scenes. (3) In visually open scenes, there are no significant differences in the participants’ sense of coherence even though the physical enclosure is changed. (4) Due to the investigation of spatial configurations of PP, when compared to other variables (coherence and legibility), it is demonstrated that enclosure will be more significant in terms of refuge.

AB  - Rapid urban expansion leads to the continuous deterioration of the urban thermal environment, which endangers the sustainable development of the city; meanwhile, countries all over the world are becoming increasingly interested in the mitigating effects of urban green spaces on heat islands. In this context, many studies show that pocket parks play an important role in optimizing the thermal environment of urban blocks, especially with the high-intensity development of urban blocks. Moreover, many cities in China have become mature, and it is difficult to open up large green areas. Therefore, to improve the urban thermal environment in summer, it is necessary to adapt to an efficient pocket-park design strategy in blocks. To consider the impact of block development intensity on the design strategy of pocket parks, three pocket parks in blocks with different floor-area ratios in the central area of Xi’an were selected as examples. This research compares the effects of tree density and green-space layout on the thermal environment in different floor-area ratio districts on a summer day using environmental simulation (ENVI-met). The results show that the design strategies of pocket parks in urban blocks with different development intensities are different. High tree density performs better from the perspective of improving the urban thermal environment. For the low and medium development intensity blocks, the effects of the open green space and closed green space are similar, while the open green space layout can significantly improve thermal comfort in high-intensity development blocks.

AB  - The rainwater system is an important part of the urban infrastructure as well as a key hub for maintaining the dynamic operation of the city and a clear indicator of the level of urban development. With the rapid development of urbanization, the hardened area of roads and residential areas has increased, and the construction of rainwater systems is so far insufficient, causing the urban waterlogging and water pollution problems to become increasingly serious. Accordingly, combined with the “sponge city” construction concept of the six-character policy of “seepage, retention, storage, use, purification, and drainage,” we propose to adopt measures for the local conditions and to reasonably select sponge city engineering measures to increase rainwater utilization, effectively reduce rainwater runoff, and alleviate the city waterlogging and water pollution problems. We used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate the effect of a sponge city “pocket park” rainwater system in Chaohu City before and after the transformation. The results showed that the pocket park after the renovation was well controlled, the waterlogging was basically eliminated, the water quality pollution was clearly improved, and the ecological environment was significantly improved.

AB  - Cities have introduced street experiments, among others, in order to cope with the urgent health challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. They are primarily intended to allow people to move safely in urban spaces according to physical distancing requirements. It has been suggested that street experiments have the potential to not only respond to pressing needs, but to also trigger systemic change in mobility. This paper explores urban case studies and demonstrates how pandemic-induced street experiments provide a solution to specific challenges to mobility and public space. There are, however, issues concerning equity and citizen participation. Finally, we find that pandemic-induced street experiments have a higher acceptance among the public and authorities, a more permanent character and a greater embeddedness in long-term planning agendas. The paper concludes that the pandemic stimulated the introduction of street experiments and fostered their potential to enable systemic change in urban mobility. © 2022 Royal Dutch Geographical Society / Koninklijk Nederlands Aardrijkskundig Genootschap.

TI  - Rethinking the distribution of urban green spaces in Mexico City: Lessons from the COVID-19 outbreak
AU  - Mayen Huerta, C.
T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed inequalities that are expected to widen if no action is taken to support the most marginalized populations. One such inequality is the distribution of urban green spaces (UGS), which are essential to pandemic recovery. Cities that aim to be inclusive and resilient should assess whether access to their UGS is equitably distributed among the population and identify the areas where these spaces are most needed. This study therefore examines the equity of access to UGS in Mexico City at the neighborhood level using network analysis. First, access to UGS was identified at a threshold of 300 m, regardless of UGS size. Second, access was differentiated by the functional level of the UGS, which primarily depends on their size, with larger UGS having more extensive catchment areas. The results of this study suggest a deficit of access to small green spaces in most of the neighborhoods of Mexico City, with the neighborhoods with higher rates of poverty showing an even lower average of UGS access. The results further highlight which neighborhoods in Mexico City should receive priority attention and funding for UGS to mitigate the disproportionate effects of public health crises. This is critical for future city planning and may be used as a roadmap for identifying priority neighborhoods in other cities with similar segregation patterns. © 2022 The Authors

AU  - Vakkayil, J.
T2  - Urban Studies
AB  - This study examines how community-driven urban do-it-yourself initiatives maintain appropriate levels of openness while ensuring sufficient degrees of social order. For this, a specific event is analysed using an analytic framework that differentiates decided and emergent orders. The results indicate how various aspects of the event feature combinations of these orders that serve to sustain it and produce desired outcomes. These combinations indicate certain key factors that facilitate the balance of order and openness in community-driven initiatives. The paper concludes with reflections on the practical implications. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2022.

T2  - Frontiers in Environmental Science
AB  - Public parks are critical resources for physical activity (PA). Pocket parks within neighborhoods play an essential role in the elder’ daily life. A deep understanding of pocket park use and park-based PA for older adults supports the better design of outdoor spaces. Gender differences have been confirmed in previous studies. Indeed, it was observed that more males visit parks than females, and males are likely to be vigorously active. However, almost all the studies were conducted in western countries, and none has yet focused on the Chinese elderly. The main objective of this study is to investigate gender differences in park-based PA in the Chinese middle-aged and elderly population. In Zongbei Park (Chengdu, China), video recording is used from 07:00 a.m. to 07:00 p.m. to document numbers, gender, age group, and type of activity. Demographic variations of park use patterns and energy expenditure are analyzed. The study findings indicated that most users (92.05%) were middle-aged and elderly. Significant gender variations were found in the number of total and five types of activities (p < 0.01), respectively. Although more old males than females were observed in Zongbei Park, the total METs and mean METs per male were lower than females. A majority (65.66%) of the older adults were seen playing cards/mahjong. It will lead to a significant number of sedentary older adults. As China faces severe healthcare challenges due to the problem of aging, it becomes essential to construct age-friendly design pocket parks. More attention should be paid to address the park-based PA gender gap. Copyright © 2022 Li, Niu and Mou.

T2  - Cities
AB  - Leftover spaces are constitutive elements of the city structure. The accurate selection of and intervention in certain hotspots can lead to an urban development that slowly takes over. The design intervention has a special effect on preventing the transition into vacancy; hence, user preferences should be properly considered. In 2017, the global population of adults aged 60 and upper reached 962 million. To address the needs of the elderly, we need to define local relevant design approaches. This research seeks to identify the elderly's preferences, particularly their use of open spaces. Application of the mixed-methodology with the BWM-questionnaire to vacant lands resulted in: a natural landscape with diverse vegetation and other facilities, gentle leisure activities, and community gardening as essential intervention attributes, leading to an ideal environment for the elderly. The innovation is implementing a mixed approach, BWM questionnaire, and considering both experts and public preferences to represent the demands of the elderly in cities. The kind of intervention and the needs of the elderly, particularly in restricted outdoor spaces, have still not been intensively reported. As these areas are too restricted, design components will play a greater role. Consequently, temporary, flexible, and experimental responses to leftover spaces are provided. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Journal of Transport and Land Use
AB  - During the spring and summer of 2020, cities across the world responded to the global COVID-19 pandemic by converting roadway facilities into open pedestrian spaces. These conversions improved access to public open space, but measuring the variation in that improvement among different populations requires clear definitions of access and methods for measuring it. In this study, we evaluate the change in a utility-based park accessibility measure resulting from street conversions in Alameda County, Califor-nia. Our utility-based accessibility measure is constructed from a park activity location choice model we estimate using mobile device data — supplied by StreetLight Data, Inc. — representing trips to parks in that county. The estimated model reveals heterogeneity in inferred affinity for park attributes among different sociodemographic groups. We find, for example, that neighborhoods with more lower-income residents and those with more residents of color show a greater preference for park proximity while neighborhoods with higher incomes and those with more white residents show a greater preference for park size and amenities. We then apply this model to examine the accessibility benefits resulting from COVID-19 street conversions to create a set of small park-like open spaces; we find that this policy has improved equity in that marginalized communities including Black, Hispanic, and low-income households receive a disproportionate share of the policy benefits, relative to the population distribution. © 2022 Gregory S.

T2  - Sustainable Cities and Society
AB  - To simultaneously promote health, economic, and environmental sustainability, a number of cities worldwide have established bike-sharing systems (BSS) that complement the conventional public transport systems. As the rapid spread of COVID-19 becoming a global pandemic disrupted urban mobility due to government-imposed lockdowns and the heightened fear of infection in crowded spaces, populations were increasingly less likely to use public transportation and instead shifted toward alternative transport systems, including BSS. In this study, we use probabilistic machine learning in a quasi-experimental research design to identify how the relevance of a comprehensive set of factors to predict the use of Bicing (the BSS in Barcelona) may have changed as COVID-19 unfolded. We unpack the key factors in predicting the use of Bicing, uncovering evidence of increasing bike-related built infrastructure (e.g., tactical urbanism), trip distance, and the income levels of neighborhoods as the most relevant predictors. Moreover, we find that the relevance of the factors in predicting Bicing usage has generally decreased during the global pandemic, suggesting altered societal behavior. Our study enhances the understanding of BSS and societal behavior, which can have important implications for developing resilient programs for cities to adopt sustainable practices through transport policy, infrastructure planning, and urban development. © 2022 The Author(s)

AU  - Heathcott, J.

T2  - Journal of Urbanism
AB  - The making of new public space in already crowded urban landscapes involves intricate considerations of design, policy, and politics. This paper examines these considerations in the case of Mexico City's Pocket Park Program, an ambitious project undertaken by a specially created entity called the Public Space Authority. Drawing on close reading of archival documents, field observation, and spatial analysis, we consider the design and policy performance of the program over its short life from 2012 to 2018. To develop a grounded view of the program, we examined three pocket parks in different zones of the city using a modified version of an evaluation instrument developed by urban planning scholar Vikas Mehta. We find that the design of the pocket parks has been largely successful in creating meaningful new public spaces, but that the political and policy apparatus structuring the program faced a range of challenges that prevented it from reaching their goal of 150 new pocket parks. We conclude that good urban design was not enough to effect meaningful change in the public space portfolio of Mexico City; rather, the misalignment between politics, policy, and design frustrated efforts to achieve transformations in public space at the urban scale. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Contributions of Natural Carbon Sink Capacity and Carbon Neutrality in the Context of Net-Zero Carbon Cities: A Case Study of Hangzhou
AU  - Fan, Y.
AU  - Wei, F.
T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - Facing the global climate change crisis, many cities have proposed the goal to achieve net-zero carbon cities. The natural carbon sink in urban space is indispensable for net-zero carbon cities, but the existing measurement system has shortcomings in the measurement elements and precision. This leads to unclear control objectives and elements of spatial planning, and the relevant planning strategies lack the support of quantitative results. We included the often-ignored natural carbon sink space and soil in the measurement scope. Taking Hangzhou as an example, we built a natural carbon sink capacity measurement system with respect to the carbon sequestration and storage capacity, measured the natural carbon sink, and evaluated its carbon neutrality’s contribution in urban space. The results showed that the carbon sink capacity of soil and small green spaces in built-up areas could affect the quantity and spatial pattern of the measurement results. Both should be included in the measurement system to improve corresponding spatial planning strategies’ reliability and feasibility. Additionally, Hangzhou’s annual natural carbon sequestration offset approximately 9.87% of the carbon emissions in the same year. With respect to the contribution to carbon neutrality, the role of natural carbon sinks in urban space was necessary, but the effect was limited. Therefore, strategies to reduce carbon emissions are integral for the net-zero carbon goal. Some spatial planning strategies to improve the urban natural carbon sink capacity are discussed. A more precise and comprehensive understanding of the urban natural carbon sink capacity can support the construction of a net-zero carbon city better. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The mitigation effects of park green space on Urban Heat Island (UHI) have been extensively documented. However, the relative effects of the configuration of park components on land surface temperature (LST) inside the park and indicators (i.e., park cooling intensity and distance) surrounding the park is largely unknown. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to explore the quantitative impacts of configuration and morphology features under different urban park scales on the cooling effect. In this study, based on Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS images on 3 August 2015 and 16 August 2020 during summer daytime, the LSTs of Shanghai City were retrieved by atmospheric correction method. Then, the relationships of park landscape features with LSTs in the park and typical indicators representing cooling efficiency of 24 parks on different grades were analyzed. The results showed that the average temperature in urban parks was, respectively, 1.46 °C and 1.66 °C lower than that in the main city of Shanghai in 2015 and 2020, suggesting that urban parks form cold islands in the city. The landscape metrics of park area (PA), park perimeter (PP), green area (GA) and water area (WA), were key characteristics that strong negatively affect the internal park LSTs. However, the park perimeter-to-area ratio (PPAR) had a significant positive power correlation with the park LSTs. Buffer zone analysis showed that LST cools down by about 0.67 °C when the distance from the park increases by 100 m. The Maximum Cooling Distance (MCD) for 2015 and 2020 had a significant correlation with PA, PC, PPAR, GA and WA, and increased sharply within the park area of 20 ha. However, the medium park group had the largest Maximum Cooling Intensity (MCI) in both periods, followed by the small park group. There could be a trade-off relationship between the MCD and MCI in urban parks, which is worth pondering to research. This study could be of great significance for planning and constructing park landscapes, alleviating Urban Heat Island effect and improving urban livability. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Investigating the spatial distribution of urban parks from the perspective of equity-efficiency: Evidence from Chengdu, China
AU  - Zhang, J.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - Urban parks play a crucial role in urban public green infrastructure, providing recreational places for urban residents while carrying values of aesthetics, ecology, humanities, economy, life, and society. However, achieving an equitable and efficient spatial layout of urban parks is a challenging task due to limited urban space resources, which requires further exploration. This study employed multisource big data and GIS technology to constructed an indicator system for evaluating the equity-efficiency of urban park spatial distribution. We examined the spatial distribution of 85 parks across 62 sub-districts in the main urban area of Chengdu, the largest city in western China and the first Park City of China. The results demonstrated that equity was polarized, with an indicator value ranging from 0 to 0.77 and an average value of 0.32. The sub-district of Sansheng had the highest equity, while Wenjia and Kanghe had the lowest equity. Twenty-one sub-districts had no parks, and the equity of park spatial distribution in these areas was low. The efficiency indicator ranged from 0.20 to 0.62, with an average value of 0.40. The efficiency of the main urban area was high in the southwest and low in the northeast. The sub-district of Huangtianba had the highest efficiency, while Jinguanyi had the lowest efficiency. In the two-dimensional quadrant of equity-efficiency, 24 sub-districts had high equity and high efficiency, 13 sub-districts had high equity and low efficiency, 4 sub-districts had low equity and high efficiency, and 21 sub-districts had low equity and low efficiency. At the district level, only Chenghua District's park was spatial equitable and efficient, surpassing the average level of the main urban area. Finally, we discussed the findings in the context of planning policies for Chengdu in recent years. We proposed that strengthening the construction of small urban parks and green spaces, improving park facilities to meet the diverse social needs of people, and enhancing the quality and attractiveness of the parks are crucial for the future development of park green spaces in the main urban areas of Chengdu. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Reaping the Fruits of Informal Urbanism An Ethnography of Tactical Gardening in Limassol, Cyprus
AU  - Kouros, T.
T2  - Built Environment
AB  - Research on informal urbanism has shown that certain informal activities are often discouraged or seen as requiring regulation, while others are endorsed by city authorities. An indicative example is guerrilla gardening, the illicit cultivation of someone else’s land, usually positively perceived as a form of activism. This article illustrates a case from the Global South where guerrilla gardening poses a threat to public spaces, through examining how it is part of an att empt by home and business owners to spill over their legal boundaries and expand into public spaces around their homes and businesses, most commonly for private gain, sometimes through making those spaces unusable for others. By employing ethnographic research, the article illustrates how plants are being tactically deployed to expand private space into public. It presents results of ethnographic fi eldwork in two parts of Limassol, Cyprus, a relatively poor and neglected neighbourhood and the Limassol Marina, an area that has witnessed a rapid – if not rabid – development in the past few years. It illustrates a unique case where informal tactical gardening interventions in public space may exclude community members – sometimes even from using a public space – as opposed to most literature that considers guerrilla gardening as a pathway to producing engaging and sustainable communities. The main contributions of this article lie in the dark side of tactical gardening which is not necessarily resistance oriented. © 2022. Built Environment.All Rights Reserved

AB  - This article tells the story of how Tallinn urban gardener Anton turned from community gardening to guerrilla gardening. While both gardening types have recently been critically studied focusing on the tension between cooperation with or a rebellious act against neoliberal urban governance regimes, this paper investigates the topic from a more-than-human theory perspective. Building on Anton's practitioner memoirs and in-depth interviews with city officials and gardening activists, the paper emphasizes the role of materialities, encounters and emotions involved in governing and practicing urban gardening in Tallinn. In exposing the case, it shows how strong emotions driving early community gardening experiments elicited the institutionalization of a more controlled governance model for community gardening. This subsequently fostered an alienation of the first-generation community gardening activist from the gardens, in particular Anton, who consequently turned towards guerrilla gardening. Looking at this process from a more-than-human perspective allows us to paint a nuanced and interwoven picture of urban gardening without diminishing the actions undertaken as a mere opposition to the status quo. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AU  - Ha, J.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Research on the association between urban green space and mental health has largely focused on the presence or quantity of green space, rather than on the spatial distribution of green spaces within the urban landscape. We therefore investigated the relationship between the amount, composition, and spatial distribution of urban green space and the level of psychological distress reported by residents of a large metropolitan city (Chicago, Illinois, USA). We used mental health data collected from 6405 residents in 61 communities by the Chicago Department of Public Health as part of their Healthy Chicago Survey, and quantified landscape metrics related to the amount and configuration of green space within these community ‘landscapes’. Using generalized linear mixed models that controlled for socio-economic confounds, we found that residents reported less psychological distress within urban landscapes that had small-sized water bodies and greater distances between forested areas, which tend to characterize the distribution of large forest parks throughout Chicago. In terms of total green space, however, psychological distress levels were lower in landscapes having a disaggregated distribution of urban green spaces (i.e., many small green spaces) relative to a single (or a few) large green spaces. Our study thus highlights that the configuration of urban green space may be as important as the amount of green space to the mental health of urban residents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cities, due to population density and the complexity of human interactions, experience specific problems arising from their functioning in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many scientists who publish their findings in contemporary literature agree on the need to shape pandemic resilient cities by making changes to the functional-spatial structure and preparing cities for rapid revitalization [regeneration] in the post-pandemic period. The main objective of the research is to identify the most important problems regarding service infrastructure deficiencies in the nine medium-sized Polish cities selected for research located in the Warsaw agglomeration, which are well connected with Warsaw. The research was based on: analysis of selected GIS spatial data, demographic data from the Polish Central Statistical Office, surveys among residents, on their needs during pandemic constraints. The focus was on three important aspects of development in the era of the pandemic: access to first-need services, access to greenery and active recreation areas, accessibility and transport efficiency problems. The research revealed changes in the way people travel and do their essential shopping, inadequate cycling infrastructure and problems with the availability of essential services close to where they live. The research programme varies, although the diagnosis and the possibility of transforming the functional-spatial structure of the cities studied as typical medium-sized cities in the impact zone of a large centre dominate. The conclusions provide examples of proposals for tactical urbanism planning solutions that could rapidly improve the quality of residence in a low-budget way. Finally, the proposals and guidelines for creating sustainable pandemic resilient cities are described. The article investigates the aspect of urban resilience related to transport, services, relaxation, while using the method of tactical urbanism as a remedy for cities' pandemic problems. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Due to the increase in population, there are fewer open spaces creating urban voids in cities nowadays. However, the opportunities made available to people by urban voids adequately indicate the necessity and significance of urban open spaces. The lack of proper planning and a good perception of the place led to the formation of lost spaces. These lost spaces are found everywhere and are treated as waste spaces. By reclaiming these urban voids, we can change them into public gathering spaces, pocket parks, or any user-friendly space admired by the users. The objective of the study is to determine why these waste spaces are called urban voids and are not utilized to their full potential. The identified area for the case study is near Railway Colony in Multan. The selected area is L-shaped and connected with the base of a flyover, which creates a huge void. The spatial methodology, which is based on identifying the physical conditions and surveys, which depend on user ratings, was the foundation of the research methodology. Users assigned ratings for the space performance, which was determined by the spatial analysis approach and differed in terms of space structure and attributes. A total of 280 participants (118 females and 162 men) rated the technical, functional, and aesthetic performance of the spaces they occupy using a Likert attitude scale, with 70 individuals from each of the identified connected urban voids under the flyover. The results showed that space performance affects user satisfaction and the space usage level after design interventions. Copyright © 2023 Aleha, Zahra, Qureshi, Marri, Siddique and Hussain.

T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Introduction: The increase of urban areas and their infrastructure network is homogenizing the landscape and threatening biodiversity and ecosystems functions and services. Wildflower meadows have a high biodiversity value and can prosper in degraded areas dominated by nitrophilous species, making them suitable to be used in peri-urban and urban areas to promote local flora, create habitat for pollinators and other small fauna, and increase overall biodiversity. Moreover, the application of wildflowers seed mixes suitable for rehabilitating anthropized environments should be restricted to native species of regional origin, and the results properly monitored. However, thorough monitoring of seed mixes evolution is uncommon. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a seed mix of wild native species developed to promote grassland diversity in Mediterranean peri-urban areas. Methods: The study was divided into two sequential phases. Firstly, a preparatory phase consisted in developing two seed mixes and sowing them (autumn 2016) in ex-situ plots (three plots of 5 × 2 m2 per mix) at an experimental field to choose the one with the best performance. The second phase consisted of the in-situ application (autumn 2018) of the chosen seed mix by sowing 14 plots (10 × 2 m2) in pocket parks distributed along pedestrian trails of South Portugal. All plots were monitored through floristic surveys for two springs (ex-situ trials: 2017 and 2018; in-situ trials: 2019 and 2020). Results: All sowed species germinated in the in-situ plots over the first 2 years. The seed mix application positively contributed to the floristic community, generating a significant increase in the total species richness, diversity, evenness, and vegetation cover. The seed mix establishment did not require watering nor soil fertilizing and the mowing frequency was low (once in late spring), contributing to sustainable and low-cost management of these green areas. Discussion: The tested seed mix promoted native flora diversity rapidly and seems suitable for use in peri-urban context under identical climate conditions. Given the small number of native seed mixes tested in the Mediterranean, this study represents a contribution toward improved management standards of native flora diversity in Mediterranean green urban and peri-urban areas.

TI  - Preparing surfaces for shredding: Skateboarding, repair, and care across scales
AU  - McDuie-Ra, D.
AU  - Campbell, J.
T2  - Area
AB  - In cities around the world, skateboarders repair surfaces and objects for the purposes of play using techniques to fill, smooth, and fabricate. Research in social and cultural geography focuses on the ways citizens repair and care for material objects using do-it-yourself (DIY) practices. Despite continuities, repair work by skateboarders does not strive to improve neglected, absent, or dysfunctional infrastructure for the common good, as in cases from literature on DIY urbanism, nor to subvert objects, texts, and surfaces to make political statements, as in cases from literature on tactical urbanism. Skateboarders do repair and care work to prepare surfaces for playful damage benefitting other skaters and onlookers enjoying the spectacle. By exploring these widespread but under-researched acts of repair and care and the circuits of knowledge that reproduce them, this paper makes four arguments. First, skateboarders do repair and care work to generate ‘spots’ for skateboarding from assemblages of objects and surfaces intended for other purposes. Transforming spots brings otherwise mundane patches of the city to life through thousands of tiny acts of repair and care. Second, repair and care work by skateboarders is most effective when barely visible to people outside the culture. However, repaired surfaces make their way to large audiences, often millions of viewers, through skateboard photography and video, giving some of them an outsized life across time and space. Third, knowledge about techniques of repair and care are considered an important part of skate culture to be learned and shared. Protocols of care shape acceptable degrees of modification to surfaces and objects, and as skateboarding globalises so too do these protocols. Fourth, acts of repair and care have no guarantees of longevity. Hours of labour can be destroyed by direct acts to stop skateboarding and by indirect acts emanating from dynamics of urban change.

TI  - Taming The Wilds: tactical urbanism and creative placemaking in the revitalisation of a nature reserve in Johannesburg, South Africa
AU  - Gregory, J.J.
T2  - Bulletin of Geography. Socio-economic Series
AB  - The use of tactical urbanism and creative placemaking in the revitalisation of public space has received growing research interest. In Johannesburg, there is evidence of these approaches in the revitalisation of The Wilds, a nature reserve located near the inner-city. The Wilds experienced neglect and decline due to increased crime. By the mid-2010s, an artist championed the bottom-up revitalisation of The Wilds through routine maintenance, the introduction of public art, and events to encourage engagement with the space. This study draws on personal communication and semi-structured interviews with key informants and utilises netnography. It was found that the use of public art and social media resulted in an increase in visitor numbers and volunteers who assisted in the maintenance, restoration and engagement with the space. The use of tactical urbanism and creative placemaking, however, has brought volunteers into conflict with the city over the usage and co-management of The Wilds. © 2023 (James J.

AB  - Urban green space is increasingly viewed as essential infrastructure to build resilience to climate change by retaining water in the city landscape and balancing ecohydrological partitioning into evapotranspiration for cooling and groundwater recharge. Quantifying how different vegetation types affect water partitioning is essential for future management, but paucity of data and the complex heterogeneity of urban areas make water balance estimates challenging. Here, we provide a preliminary assessment of water partitioning from different sized patches of trees and grass as well as from sealed surfaces. To do this, we used limited field observations together with an advanced, process-based tracer-aided ecohydrological model at a meso-scale (5 km2) in central Berlin, Germany. Transpiration was the dominant green water flux accounting for over 50% of evapotranspiration in the modelled area. Green water fluxes were in general greater from trees compared with grass, but grass in large parks transpired more water compared with grass in small parks that were intensively used for recreation. Interception evaporation was larger for trees compared with grass, but soil water evaporation was greater for grass compared with trees. We also show that evapotranspiration from tree-covered areas comprise almost 80% of the total evapotranspiration from the whole model domain while making up less than 30% of the surface cover. The results form an important stepping-stone towards further upscaling over larger areas and highlights the importance of continuous high-resolution hydrological measurements in the urban landscape, as well as the need for improvements to ecohydrological models to capture important urban processes. © 2022 The Authors.

T2  - Street Art and Urban Creativity
AB  - The advertising market draws on elements and aesthetics from other areas and disciplines, appropriating artistic imaginaries of Street Art, subverting them to change the user's perception of messages. The media increasingly show creative solutions that take ideas from the art world as a reference. They reuse pre-existing images to give them a new message that responds to a different discourse. In this article, we will study how the imaginary of advertising appropriates urban movements, analysing the influences of the artist Banksy on persuasive commercial activity and vice versa. The conclusions of this analysis are that the very appropriation, an inherent consequence of the art and advertising binomial, improves the creative dimension of the works in both areas. Communication tends to reuse the artistic imaginary for commercial purposes, while the artist drinks from commercial aesthetics to represent the reality in which he lives. There is also a proliferation of the number of pieces related to the actions of the author Banksy in recent years.

AB  - Urbanization transforms the landscape and consequently affects biodiversity. Cities are heteroge-neous landscapes due to a differential distribution of human activities, infrastructure, and vegetation compo-sition. Bird assemblages vary according to such variations. In Argentina, assessments of the effect of urbanization on bird assemblages come from large capital cities, whereas in intermediate-size cities studies are scarce. Intermediate-size cities present higher growth rates than capital cities. Studies on the effect of Urban Land Uses (ULU) can contribute to the planning of urban growth. We evaluated the variation in taxonomic diversity of bird assemblages at different ULUs in Santo Tomé, an Argentine city of 66 133 inhabitants. We performed bird counts in seven ULUs (the centre, the suburban sector, the peri-urban sector, small urban parks, the mi-litary base, the riverside walkway, and the urban reserve). In each ULU, we located 10 transects of 100 m long x 50 m wide. In each transect we recorded bird species and their abundance and the number of pedestrians and vehicles. Taxonomic diversity varied among the different ULUs. The centre presented the lowest richness and diversity, in contrast to the highest values for these variables found in the riverside walkway and the urban reserve. The rest of the ULU presented intermediate levels of richness and diversity. The structure and composition of bird assemblages varied among ULUs. Our study reinforces the importance of ULU characterized by high vegetation cover, low levels of human activity, and with vegetation management for conservation purposes. © 2022, Aves Argentinas - Asociacion Ornitologica del Plata.

AB  - Urban green spaces provide natural habitat for birds in urban landscapes, yet the effects of noise and surrounding urban morphology on bird community structure and distribution are not well understood in Latin America, the second most urbanized region in the world. Santiago of Chile is the single city belonging to the Mediterranean ecosystem in South America and is subject to extensive urbanization as seen throughout Latin America. We examined the role of 65 urban green spaces—6 large urban parks (PAR) and 59 small green spaces (SGS)—in harboring native birds during winter 2019, analyzing the quality of green areas in terms of vegetation (i.e. NDVI, native vegetation, and tree cover), exotic bird species, noise levels, and surrounding urban morphology (i.e. building height and cover). Significantly higher noise levels were detected in SGS, along with significantly greater exotic bird (n = 4) richness and abundance than PAR, which possessed significantly greater native bird (n = 25) richness and abundance. Native birds were more abundant than exotic birds in green spaces with average noise levels < 52 dB and average NDVI > 0.5. Occupancy models indicate that green space occupancy by 50% of modeled native bird species was influenced by maximum noise levels, playing a larger role than vegetation (30%) and urban morphology (0%). We stress the importance of developing networks of large green spaces in rapidly urbanizing regions, with abundant tree cover, surrounded by smaller urban morphology, and regulating noise levels to ensure the conservation of native bird communities in cities, particularly those that are threatened. © 2022, The Author(s).

AU  - Mensah, J.K.
T2  - Energy Research and Social Science
AB  - Despite many academic discussions on the importance of sustainable and reliable energy to informal settlement dwellers, there is limited evidence on the delivery of electricity in informal settlements, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using the concept of tactical urbanism, this study examined electricity delivery and access to informal settlement dwellers in Accra, Ghana as an important component of meeting SDG seven. The paper analyses evidence collected through three focus group discussions of thirty informal settlement dwellers in three communities in Accra. The findings showed that whereas access to electricity in informal settlements has improved significantly, this increase is a result of corruption and connivance with electricity officials and that informal settlement dwellers pay exorbitantly to access and use electricity. This paper contributes to the growing body of scholarship on sustainable electricity in urban informal settlements in the Global South by documenting the experiences of informal settlement dwellers in Accra, Ghana. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Does pattern matter? Exploring the pathways and effects of urban green space on promoting life satisfaction through reducing air pollution
AU  - Wu, L.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - Urban green space is widely acknowledged to promote public health through multiple pathways. However, there is limited understanding of how the spatial patterns of green space might play different roles in such a process. This study examined potential pathways through which spatial patterns of green space improved people's life satisfaction (LS) by reducing air pollution. A partial least squares structural equation model was adopted to explore these pathways in sampled urban areas (township) of China (n = 60). Green space spatial patterns were measured using landscape metrics of size, aggregation, fragmentation, and diversity. The results did not show that green space spatial pattern promoted LS by reducing air pollution. However, green space size and fragmentation were negatively associated with air pollution (mainly PM 2.5, PM 10, and NO 2). The pattern of highly densely distributed small green spaces was related to higher LS, as was high diversity of green space type. Simply adopting a fragmented green space pattern to reduce air pollution might be simultaneously associated with reduced LS. This alerts decision-makers and planners to the potential “double-edged sword” effect of optimizing green space structures to improve air quality, which may not yield strongly favorable results due to the impacts that hinder LS. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Temporary/tactical or T/T urbanism is a global movement in urban design and planning encompassing small experimental interventions typically involving diverse actors in the conversion of under-utilised city spaces. Its outcomes include enhancing innovation, urban intensification, community engagement, place identity, and resilience. Yet questions remain about the extent to which large organisations engaging in T/T urbanism may be part of an increasingly legitimised, even sanitised approach to what has been a disruptive element of urban design and planning. In Tasmania, studies of T/T urbanism are limited. The qualitative research reported here addresses that gap and analyses street interviews and participants’ opinions about a temporary parklet proposed by the University of Tasmania in the Hobart central business district. Analysed thematically, those views and additional insights from the literature suggest it is possible for a large organisation to engage local communities and serve public interests using T/T urbanism initiatives but that the outcomes are not guaranteed. © 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Temporary use of urban vacant spaces: A pro-poor land use strategy in the Global South
AU  - Agheyisi, J.E.
T2  - Journal of Urban Affairs
AB  - This paper examines temporary use of urban vacant spaces (UVS) as everyday activity by disparate groups of entrepreneurs largely in the informal sector of the urban economy. It extends the academic discussions of temporary use as a component of the development processes of cities in developing countries rather as opportunity for urban regeneration and innovative urbanism in the Global North. Using Benin City as a case study, the paper employs snowball sampling and semi-structured interviews of participant temporary users to explain the grassroots mobilization of UVS for temporary use within the context of the opportunities, vulnerabilities, and precarities associated with the use of vacant spaces. The paper revealed that temporary use of UVS in Benin City is dominated by informal economic activities. Availability of vacant spaces enables temporary use to thrive. The everyday use of vacant spaces challenges the powers of formal place-making decision-makers who decide whether temporary use of UVS can be accepted, not accepted, or tolerated. The paper recommends that space users should be at the center of temporary use research and policy debates, and tactical urbanism should be adopted as the new urban planning paradigm rather than the bulldozer approach to urban renovation in the developing countries. © 2023 Urban Affairs Association.

T2  - Journal of Engineering and Applied Science
AB  - Several urban agendas related to different urban spaces in cities are documented in the global literature. This research explores social interactions in voids between buildings using tactical urbanism. As part of this study, we examine changes in perceptions of the use of spaces between buildings by comparing critical differentiation factors before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted an online survey for three months among residents in Egypt using a comparative method based on personal, residential, and district characteristics. The results revealed that during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, the spaces between buildings played a critical role. According to the conclusion, tactical urbanism, rapid and low-cost intervention, material availability, and small-scale pop-ups are essential for reducing the adverse effects of COVID-19. These findings confirmed that the longer the outbreak persisted, the more planning shifted to smaller public spaces within walking distance, resulting in long-term activities rather than large areas of land being planned. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - Comparing Climate Politics and Adaptation Strategies in African Cities: Challenges and Opportunities in the State-Community Divide
AU  - Mususa, P.
AU  - Marr, S.
T2  - Urban Forum
AB  - Residents of African municipalities exhibit a lengthy and varied history of coping with conditions of pervasive precarity and uncertainty in the context of an unevenly present state. The climate crisis compounds these challenges. Based on case studies from across the continent, this introduction to the Special Issue on the Politics of Climate Action in Africa’s Cities presents research oriented around questions of “do-it-yourself” urbanism, sustainable development, and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts undertaken by socio-economically vulnerable citizens. It offers insight into how the urban poor respond to ongoing urban climate crises, the variable roles of an absent, ineffectual, or inattentive state, and the unequal power relations undergirding sustainability discourse and practice. It draws on a cross-regional comparative perspective that centres conversations about urban theory and development in a (urban) world succumbing to mounting pressures from climate change, environmental precarity, and pervasive inequities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Challenges to implementing circular development–lessons from London
AU  - Williams, J.
T2  - International Journal of Urban Sustainable Development
AB  - Circular development creates more resource efficient, adaptive, and ecologically healthy cities. Circular food and construction systems; the ecological regeneration of contaminated brownfield sites and circular tactical urbanism are just some of the processes and systems adopted by those implementing a circular development pathway. These produce benefits, however, there are many challenges to implementing circular development, demonstrated by two London cases. The research reveals the difficulties low-value, circular activities encounter when competing for space in London. It shows how the imbalance between local supply and demand for circular products prevents scaling-up. It suggest a lack of data monitoring the benefits of adopting circular development, undermines political support. It reveals the conflict between the reliance on civil society to engage with circular actions versus public resistance. It highlights the need for accountability and transparency in the process of implementation and for a regulatory framework to encourage circular development. © 2022 The Author(s).

T2  - Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction
AB  - City planning in the United States suffers from opaque and unresponsive processes - -egalitarian in name but in reality controlled and mediated by city officials and powerful interests, not residents. We explore methods for placing city planning directly in the hands of the people. For inspiration, we look to the democratization of knowledge production through citizen science, and examine how this trend can be paralleled in urban design. To that end, we give ordinary people pattern-based planning tools to help them redesign (and repair) urban areas. We describe a prototype for such a tool that leverages classic patterns to enable city planning by residents, and show through a series of Mechanical Turk experiments that this prototype allows ordinary people to create designs and communicate their intentions without design training or expert intervention.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - The paper presents the results of a survey questionnaire conducted in order to determine the social preferences of young adults regarding their willingness to finance pocket parks in Warsaw (Poland). The preferences concerned the impact of the appearance and attractiveness of pocket parks for the inhabitants of the capital, the impact on the microclimate, the materials used to build water reservoirs, and the effect of the respondent’s income on their willingness to finance them. The data were analyzed statistically (Kruskal–Wallis test, Mann–Whitney U logistic regression). The results show that young respondents prefer parks with natural water reservoirs. Willingness to pay was the highest in the case of natural parks and parks containing the most anthropogenically modified water reservoirs. It has been shown that the willingness to finance increased with the need for more greenery of this type and greater awareness of their positive impact on the improvement of the microclimate in the city. The higher the attractiveness of pocket parks for leisure and the higher the level of respondents’ incomes, the greater the willingness to finance them. The level of financing also depended on the materials used to build water reservoirs in parks—the more elements made of hydrotechnical concrete, the higher the level of financing. This type of relationship was not found for natural materials, which is surprising given the already well-known threat of climate change and the decrease of biodiversity. © 2022 by the authors.

T2  - Ecosystem Services
AB  - Sustainable urban and metropolitan planning is increasingly benefiting from differentiated assessments of ecosystem services. Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are particularly relevant for urban residents’ mental and physical health, yet, quantification and mapping of CES are often challenging, especially so in the Global South. The use of social media data (SMD), which has recently gained importance for assessing CES at larger spatial and temporal scales, provides a promising entry point for mitigating this informational gap in land-use planning. However, its application is mainly limited to European and North American cases and rarely applied to data-scarce urban regions in the Global South, with South America as no exception. Addressing this geographical gap, this study assesses CES of urban green spaces in the city of Cali, Colombia, based on 1,686 crowdsourced and geolocated photographs, and compares those results with a metropolitan scale CES potential assessment based on expert opinions performed in a previous study. Despite some important limitations primarily related to Flickr as a data source, we demonstrate the utility of this approach, especially for understanding the fine-scale generation of CES by small green spaces located within the urban fabric that are overlooked in the metropolitan scale expert-based assessment. These green spaces are highly relevant as inner-city pockets for CES production, especially in the form of “existence value” and “aesthetic experiences”, in contrast to green areas highlighted by experts at the metropolitan scale that serve primarily recreational purposes. Our results indicate the large potential of SMD-based CES assessment approaches for informing urban planning processes in the Global South. © 2022 The Authors

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urban pockets, although an integral part of the urban environment, often fall into the urban vacant land category. This paper aims to point out the diversity of urban pockets through their categorization, explore the ways of urban pockets’ integration into urban green infrastructure planning, and indicate the potential achievable uses of urban pockets. Six types of urban pockets in Novi Sad (Serbia) were noted and three different yet not mutually exclusive perspectives on urban pockets’ revitalization – productive, cultural and social – were proposed. This study could serve as a basis for the integration of urban pockets into urban planning theory and planning practices and as an inspiration for urban planners, landscape architects and policy-makers to create strategies for urban pockets’ utilization. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

T2  - Journal of Environmental Management
AB  - How to maximize the cooling effect of urban parks in hot extremes has been closely linked to well-beings of citizens. Few studies have quantified urban parks' cooling effect in hot extremes from both maximum and accumulative perspectives. Here, we explored 65 urban parks' cooling effect based on spatially continuous cooling curves using multiple satellite images of Greater Xi'an (34°06’ ∼34°34′ N, 108°33’ ∼109°15′ E), one of China's metropolises with frequent hot extremes during July and August in 2019 summer. From maximum perspective, the urban parks cool down as far as 151.4 m, and covering 63.62 ha area, circa five times their own area in hot extremes; from accumulative perspective, the average cooling intensity is 0.78 °C along the whole continuous cooling distance spectrum, accumulated as 153.87 °C•m. And the urban parks show stronger accumulative cooling effect in hot extremes than the relative moderate temperatures. The cooling range could be maximized in large parks with dense trees, also in complex-shaped parks with strong interaction with surrounding environment. Small parks such as neighborhood parks located in the densely populated area are with maximum efficiency, cooling down about nine times their own area, which could serve as highly efficient cooling networks. Enhancing vegetation growth and coupling both blue and green infrastructures are always effective to increase accumulative cooling intensity in hot extremes. Our findings provide nature-based solutions (NBS) to counteracting heat stresses from the intense and frequent hot extremes in the future, also helpful for energy saving in the continuing climate change scenario. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Construction of Pocket Park Network Systems in Urban Built-Up Areas: A Case Study of Harbin City
AU  - He, M.

T2  - Journal of Digital Landscape Architecture
AB  - Pocket park planning is an important tool for urban habitat enhancement, yet previous studies have not often considered pocket park network construction. In order to determine the spatial differences in the demand for pocket parks, this article adopts a systematic perspective and uses the built-up area of Harbin city as an example. It does this by extracting the existing green space network, evaluating the spatial suitability of pocket parks, and combining the two previous steps. The results show that the density of buildings and roads in the city are negatively correlated with the supply of ecological re-sources; there are differences in the demand for pocket parks among spaces in the built-up area. By comparing the current situation with the simulation, the designed network of 88 pocket park corridors will effectively alleviate the problem of green space shortage. In addition, from the perspective of the network system, we propose three strategies for constructing pocket parks for different spaces, provid-ing a new approach to enhance the urban living environment and promote the harmonious development of humans and nature. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.

T2  - Frontiers in Microbiology
AB  - Airborne fungi are ubiquitous in human living environments and may be a source of respiratory problems, allergies, and other health issues. A 12 months study was performed to investigate the diversity, concentration and community structure of culturable airborne fungi in different outdoor environments of Tianjin City, using an HAS-100B air sampler. A total of 1,015 fungal strains belonging to 175 species and 82 genera of Ascomycota 92.5%, Basidiomycota 7%, and Mucoromycota 0.3% were isolated and identified using morphological and molecular analysis. The most abundant fungal genera were Alternaria 35%, Cladosporium 18%, Penicillium 5.6%, Talaromyces 3.9%, Didymella 3%, and Aspergillus 2.8%, while the most frequently occurring species were A. alternata (24.7%), C. cladosporioides (11%), A. tenuissima (5.3%), P. oxalicum (4.53%), and T. funiculosus (2.66%). The fungal concentration ranged from 0 to 340 CFU/m3 during the whole study. Environmental factors, including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and air pressure exerted a varying effect on the presence and concentration of different fungal taxa. The four analyzed seasons showed significantly different airborne fungal communities, which were more strongly influenced by air temperature and relative humidity in spring and summer, whereas wind speed and air pressure had a stronger effect in autumn and winter. Fungal communities from green and busy sites did not show significant differences over the four analyzed seasons, which may be due to the effect of the surrounding environments characterized by high human activities on the air of the relatively small parks present in Tianjin. The present study provided valuable information on the seasonal dynamics and the environmental factors shaping the diversity and concentration of the analyzed outdoor airborne fungal communities, which can be of help for air quality monitoring, microbial contamination control, and health risk assessment in urban environments.

TI  - Young Peoples’ Construction of DIY Dirt Jumps in Melbourne, Australia, Throughout the Covid-19 Lockdowns
AU  - O’Keeffe, P.
T2  - Journal of Applied Youth Studies
AB  - Access to public space is critically important for young people, providing key opportunities for self-expression, independence, identity development and relationship building. The Covid-19 pandemic has profoundly affected how young people can engage with public spaces. In Melbourne, Australia, young people have experienced 262 days in lockdown, contributing to escalating anxiety and depression, social isolation, physical health impacts and increased exposure to family conflict and family violence. Throughout this time, there has been a proliferation of young people constructing DIY dirt jumps across Melbourne. This article analyses this unstructured production of public space, focusing on one case study and drawing from council responses. I suggest that through this practice, young people challenge adult interpretations of public space, intentionally or unintentionally, resisting adult control of public space at a time when young people have been denied opportunities for independence and autonomy. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Urban Acupuncture As a Method of Open Space Regeneration in Greek Ex-refugee Areas. The Case of Nikea, Piraeus
AU  - Tousi, E.
AU  - Sinou, M.
AU  - Peroul, A.
T2  - Journal of Sustainable Architecture and Civil Engineering
AB  - The paper explores the potential of implementing the principles of urban acupuncture in a selected Greek case study, taking into account international experience in the field. The research includes literature review and field work. The area of study is Nikea, an ex-refugee urban area in the Attica metropolitan region. It was founded during the 1930s to host refugees from Asia Minor. The initial Hippodamian grid offers beneficial intermediate communal spaces inside each city block and there are also larger green spaces in proximity. However, the area suffers from urban blight owed largely to the poor quality of preservation of the old refugee housing estates. A mixture of factors contributes to the complex contemporary situation characterized by opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, there is great potential for regenerating the existing intermediate communal spaces and on the other decaying refugee houses and vulnerable households intricate the already convoluted situation. The paper provides cartographic depiction and categorization of the existing open spaces highlighting also contemporary socio-spatial challenges and market driven limitations. The research describes the obstacles that hinder the activation of “urban sensitive points” in terms of urban acupuncture, also advocating for possible solutions. The paper opens dialogue on the Greek case study in terms of urban acupuncture with the view to suggest strategies to foster socio-spatial cohesion in degraded ex-refugee urban areas. This is a pilot case study with further application in other post-refugee urban areas in Greece that share common socio-spatial attributes. Thus, the topic of the paper may have a greater impact within the Greek urban context. © 2022, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas. All rights reserved.

T2  - Habitat International
AB  - COVID-19 has spread world-wide, and with multiple health, social, and economic ramifications. These present a formidable challenge for those belonging to vulnerable communities, such as those living in slums. There is now a growing literature urging attention to this challenge. However, few studies have examined the actual lived realities within these areas using direct, observational research, notwithstanding commentary elsewhere that such close attention is necessary to ensure effective action. This study took this approach in relation to a particular case-study, Kapuk Urban Village, in Jakarta, Indonesia. Drawing on an existing schema involving three spatial scales of slum areas (environs, settlement, and object), the research confirms how different built and socio-economic features can exacerbate vulnerability, and COVID-19 transmission. We also add to the body of knowledge by contributing a dimension of ‘ground-level’ research engagement. We conclude by discussing related ideas around ensuring community resilience and effective policy implementation, and recommend an “urban acupuncture” approach to encourage government regulations and actions better tailored to such communities. © 2023

T2  - Environmental Science and Pollution Research
AB  - Pocket parks, the green infrastructures with small sizes and flexible layouts, are suitable for thermal environment improvement in the urban built-up block with limited green space. To quantify the relationship between pocket parks and the thermal environment in western China, two parks in the built-up block of Xi’an were selected. By field measurement, the cooling effect could be extended 100 m from the park boundary, connecting two parks. Furthermore, the road and greening within the block demonstrate significant influence on the cooling diffusion by regression analysis. Based on ENVI-met simulation, the ratio of the tree and the grass, the layout of the tree and the grass, and the layout of the paving were analyzed at different proportions of greening and paving of the park. Finally, a combination of the daytime physiological equivalent temperature (PET) and nighttime air temperature (AT) was proposed to choose the optimum layouts: the trees concentrated in the center and the pavement with more roads. Results can provide insights for designing pocket parks based on the thermal environment improvement. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - At the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic, world leaders introduced face masking and tactical urbanism aimed at reducing physical contacts. The goal of these measures, as argued by the proponents, is to curtail community transmission of the virus to enable herd immunity. The enforcement of these measures attracted contradictions related to human rights and citizen duty. In the Global North, the rising cases of COVID-19 have been linked to resistance to regulations aimed at containing the virus. Predominantly, the younger generation perceive these measures as infringements on their freedoms and rights. Conversely, in the Global South, the implementation of COVID-19 measures has been marred by instances of human rights violations and extra-judicial killings in extreme cases. There are reported cases of arbitrary arrests, battery, and extortions consequent upon the enforcement of physical distancing and use of face masks. The paradox of the differential experiences between the Global North and South informed this article. Relying on extant literature and Procedural Justice Theory, the authors submit that rights and duties are not mutually exclusive, but can be blended through a proactive participatory process within a democratic framework. The article recommends a multi-level legislative framework for disaster management. Keywords  © 2022 Copyright 2022 by Abiodun Oladejo and Jackson Jack.

AB  - This paper analyzes the work of the Public Space Authority (AEP) in Mexico City to explore the politics of site selection in public space infrastructure investment. By focusing on a pocket parks program as a case study, we explore how governments and agencies make efforts to configure their distributional criteria for urban public goods. We develop an explanatory framework around showcase politics, where agencies favor high-profile locations to create rapid demonstrations of their programs and their effectiveness for an audience of governmental and social actors. Through showcase politics, agencies deploy their limited resources for maximum exhibitionary effects with the aim of justifying the existence of the agency and its programs as a legitimate solution to urban problems, and to support the overall political agenda of the party in power. While this decisional logic makes sense for the maintenance of a newly created agency within a bureaucracy, it contradicted the agency’s own stated policy goals to distribute public space amenities broadly throughout the Mexican capital. © 2022 Urban Affairs Association.

AU  - Argota Sánchez-Vaquerizo, J.

T2  - Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives
AB  - Current trends in urban planning aim at the reduction of space for private vehicles to promote alternative mobility, more diverse activities on streets and reduced pollution for healthier cities. Simultaneously, “tactical urbanism”, embedded within participatory processes, helps to articulate and enrich these policies. In this connection, our study evaluates a number of “what-if scenarios” of “city pruning” by means of realistic, agent-based computer simulations. They regard traffic restrictions for Barcelona with the purpose to identify the impact on travel performance and the environment. Positive counterintuitive effects related to Braess and Daganzo paradoxes are found in new alternatives to the street repurposing plans developed by the City of Barcelona. These result in a reduction of emissions (−8% of main pollutants) and traffic congestion (−14% of travel time) solely by closing some streets to motor vehicles. These findings indicate a formerly unnoticed potential to further improve the quality of urban life. Hence, the use of interactive urban models can be a powerful tool to explore and co-create policies within participatory approaches in spatial planning. Positive counterintuitive effects of street repurposing and network dismantling provide opportunities for participatory and sustainable city-making beyond the ongoing public debate. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - Temporal patterns of breeding bird assemblages in small urban parks reveal relatively low stability and asynchrony
AU  - Korňan, M.
T2  - Community Ecology
AB  - Parks serve as biodiversity centers in urban habitats and significantly affect the abundance and persistence of local bird populations. I examined bird assemblage stability, biodiversity, qualitative and quantitative composition, species turnover, changes in species ranking and composition, overall stability and synchrony in relation to park size in three small parks in the Town of Zvolen, Slovakia. Bird censuses were conducted by the combined version of the mapping method in 2014–2018. The mean species density and the total assemblage density were significantly different among parks and tended to decrease with increasing park size. The rarefied species richness and diversity measures within and between parks showed no or only very few significant differences in the five-year time series, but tended to be significantly higher in the larger parks at least in some years. The Sørensen (incidence) index-based clustering (UPGMA and cluster optimalization) almost perfectly divided year samples into three groups corresponding to the park sites, while the Horn (dominance) index only into two. None of the three species turnover metrics showed consistent patterns among parks, yet the highest mean total turnover was detected in the smallest park. Rate of assemblage changes showed decreasing trend with the increasing park size. The highest value of the assemblage stability metric was also found in the largest park. Bird assemblages showed relatively high degree of asynchrony in species abundances over time. These results indicate relatively low temporal stability, not strict boundaries and asynchrony of bird assemblages of these small parks. © 2023, Akadémiai Kiadó Zrt.

TI  - Pocket parks for human-centered urban climate change resilience: Microclimate field tests and multi-domain comfort analysis through portable sensing techniques and citizens’ science
AU  - Rosso, F.

T2  - Energy and Buildings
AB  - Dense urban areas are subject to dynamic and urgent challenges, exacerbated by anthropogenic forcing. Urban Heat Island and heatwaves pose a threat to citizens’ comfort, due to extreme microclimate conditions. In this panorama, urban parks represent effective strategies towards more livable and comfortable urban areas. In particular, small pocket parks could aid in the mitigation of such challenges in every neighborhood. Indeed, they are in close proximity to citizens, allowing large population groups to benefit from the advantage of living green areas. Therefore, this paper assesses for the first time microclimate conditions and personal multi-domain perception imputable to pocket parks, by means of human-centered experimental analyses, coupling objective and subjective assessment. Wearable monitoring-systems are employed for the assessment of granular-microclimate variables mapping, and questionnaire-surveys are collected in the pocket parks and their surroundings, for comparison purposes. Results show that, while microclimate mitigation is not extremely significant as expected (−0.5 °C air temperature, +5–10% relative humidity inside the park), perceived comfort in pocket parks is higher than on the streets, shifting from “neutral” on the close by streets to “good/very good” in the park. Therefore, a better design for microclimate mitigation of pocket parks is needed, especially taking into account the potential air stagnation, while acknowledging their fundamental societal role. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The scope of the research was to take the arcade building in the port area of Shantou Small Park in Guangdong, China, and apply the eye-tracking experiment method and semantic difference method. This entailed collecting the eye-tracking data of 16 people, implementing 334 questionnaires for evaluation, verifying the correlation between the visual elements and place identity emotions, and then screening out the visual elements that affect place identity through correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. The results show that plaque text morphological richness (p = 0.045 < 0.05, and the regression coefficient B = 0.146), the color brightness of plaque text (p = 0.031 < 0.01, and the regression coefficient B = 0.171), window morphological richness (p = 0.038 < 0.05, and the regression coefficient B = 0.106), window color brilliance (p = 0.047 < 0.01, and regression coefficient B = 0.094), and plant color brilliance (p = 0.029 < 0.05, and the regression coefficient B = 0.154) are five visual element evaluation factors that have a significant correlation with the identity and emotion of places. Although the fineness of architectural decoration is negatively correlated with place identity, it is not obviously significant. The research results provide reference for the visual control design of arcade buildings. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Since a solution towards carbon neutrality in already highly populated territories that does not profoundly alter the territories has not yet been found, territorial acupuncture, a new methodology presented in this paper, proposes a solution to this challenge and simultaneously helps to counter the dysfunctional dichotomy between large urban centres and small towns. The aim of this study is therefore to present this new concept and its operation. Hence, a phased study was carried out. Territorial acupuncture is the result of merging different theories and practices, such as Biourbanism, urban acupuncture, and energy community design. For Territorial Acupuncture, the territory is conceived as a single organism and, just like acupuncture in traditional Chinese medicine, punctual interventions (in this case, interconnected energy communities) would benefit the entire territory organism. To make the theory work properly, it will be necessary to carry out multi-scalar and multi-disciplinary analyses over the entire territory to identify the intervention points and then proceed to the design and interconnection of the individual district. Thus, Territorial Acupuncture provides a new approach to the resilience of densely populated territories, which, through punctual interventions on a district scale, benefits the entire territory by modifying energy, socio-economic, and environmental dynamics. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Around the world people are rapidly moving to cities. The rapid urbanization has led to changes in land use and land cover, which (i) modify the urban surface energy balance making the cities hotter than the surrounding rural area, (ii) exacerbate the impact of extreme weather events like heatwaves and (iii) lead to poor quality of life. City administrations around the world are undertaking drastic measures to mitigate extreme heat. Here, in this study we test a wearable sensing platform to both study pedestrian-level microclimate boundary conditions as well as the impact of urban greening on moderating excess heat in dense urban areas. The experiment presented here was conducted in New York City. Typically, the urban thermal state is estimated by means of direct observations from ground-based sensors, satellite based remote sensing techniques, and high-resolution urban climate modeling, all of which are too coarse to resolve pedestrian-level impacts, a key parameter in determining heat stress for citizens occupying the outdoors. Here a wearable and a portable sensing apparata were used to monitor key environmental parameters - air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, mean radiant temperature and solar radiation. The coupled monitoring platform included multiple sensors and a wireless data logging system which were all prototyped by the authors on open source technologies. The sensor platform was able to accurately map the thermal environment of multiple dense urban spaces, being to reproduce the spatial variability in key microclimate parameters, and the performance was comparable to traditional stationary ground-based weather stations. The results, which may be of key help also for validating microclimate forecasting models, indicate high spatial variability in temperature, humidity and solar radiation within the same urban parks. Our findings also indicate that on average small urban parks in a dense urban setting were able to reduce the air temperature by 3–7 °C in New York City with major gains during the mid-afternoon periods. © 2021

AB  - The article aims to analyze non-motorized transport initiatives by adopting the innovation-in-services approach based on multi-agents. We selected ten cases in the municipality of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Our findings identified innovations in the local context in the treatment of infrastructure for active mobility. These public services were introduced in a participatory process and a collective re-appropriation of urban space. Innovation is based on techniques and competences. The projects promote an expansion of the competences of service providers related to interactions with civil society, resulting in an integral perspective on the uses, local dynamics and behavioral issues of the users themselves. Service provider techniques are temporary and permanent intervention methodologies, and methodologies for project impact evaluation. These techniques are associated with tactical urbanism for temporary urban interventions. User techniques were identified to apply the propensity score-matching method, which aims to evaluate the impacts of an instance of intervention through the comparison of groups in addition to technical inspections and local interviews. The relationship management generated relational and organizational competences for civil society organizations. Therefore, public services for non-motorized transportation have a great deal of potential to shape innovations, following transformations intended for a sustainable urban mobility paradigm. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The use flexibility of pocket parks is one of the essential factors that determine their service compatibility, efficiency, and attraction for park users in densely populated cities. To examine the factors that affect the use flexibility of pocket parks, we collected data on the periodic use of 74 pocket parks through a field survey in Nanjing and adopted the Shannon Wiener diversity index to quantitatively measure this variable. After using a multiple regression model series, we examined the internal and surrounding factors that affect the use flexibility of pocket parks on weekdays and weekends, respectively, and compared them with those that affect the use intensity of pocket parks. The results showed that paved ground and the mixed use of surrounding land promoted both use flexibility and intensity of pocket parks. Boundary buildings and surrounding residents only promoted their use flexibility, while tree canopies and exercising facilities only promoted the use intensity of pocket parks. A significant correlation (p < 0.05) was also found between the use flexibility and intensity on weekdays. These findings can contribute to future decisions regarding pocket park planning and design in Nanjing and similar cities. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - The effect of graduated urban park size on park cooling island and distance relative to land surface temperature (LST)
AU  - Algretawee, H.
T2  - Urban Climate
AB  - Cities are usually much warmer than their surroundings. This variance in temperature between cities cores and their surroundings is called the Urban Heat Island (UHI). One of the best ways to combat UHIs is through the use of vegetation. Three urban parks were selected gradually in size. These parks were sampled monthly over a period of one year. Handheld measurement devices were used to record the temperature of the surface at ground level along a transect that extended up to 3 km beyond some park's perimeter. Study results showed that the largest cooling magnitudes was observed at the large park, which had an average cooling magnitude (PCI) of 3.28 °C and an average cooling distance (PCD) of 2500 m. Average PCI magnitude of the large park shows statistically higher than both medium park 1.69°C and small park 2.25°C),these results show that there are direct cooling benefits to be obtained by greening urban areas and can be used to identify where new parks could be located to provide cooling to urban cores. This would allow for city-wide cooling plans to be developed and enable local councils and developers to make informed decisions about the amount of green space needed to offset urban growth and its warming effects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Sustainable Cities and Society
AB  - Congested urban forms deteriorate urban ventilation, causing the problem of poor wind comfort at the pedestrian level. Pocket parks are small-scale open spaces for neighborhoods’ recreations, and they have the potential to alleviate this problem in cities, while this is rarely quantitatively investigated. This study investigates the pedestrian-level wind (PLW) flows around building arrays, and the influences of pocket park and vegetation on the mean and gust wind flows, and the wind comfort are further assessed. Steady-state Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations with the RNG k-ε model are used and validated with the benchmark experiments that give correlation coefficients above 0.80, including winds around a building array and trees. Results indicate that pocket park amplifies the mean and the gust flows in the streets under the perpendicular inflow wind, while attenuates the flows under the oblique and the parallel inflow winds. Inside the pocket park, an outdoor shelter space is created for pedestrian to relax and gather when winds in the streets are overly high. In this case, the vegetation promotes wind comfort for short-term sitting. These findings provide evidence for quantifying the effect of pocket parks with and without vegetation in achieving a healthy outdoor open space. © 2022

AB  - Context: Due to considerable declines in African wildlife populations, most large African mammals are managed inside protected areas. Protected areas come in various sizes, and have different environmental features, climates and management strategies (i.e. 'hands-on' or 'hands-off') that can influence an animals' homeostasis. White rhinos (Ceratotherium simum simum) are found almost exclusively within protected areas where population sizes are driven by natural factors and poaching pressures. Aims: Our aim was to understand the effect of natural and anthropogenic factors on the adrenocortical response of white rhinos within three protected areas. Specifically, we wanted to understand how poaching pressure, protected area size (<500 km2), season (wet and dry) and rainfall patterns were responsible for driving adrenocortical activity in white rhino. Methods: To understand the relationship between rhino adrenocortical responses and different environmental and anthropogenic stressors, we quantified glucocorticoid metabolites in faecal samples (fGCM) collected from four populations within three protected areas (i.e. two small parks, one big park) during the wet and dry seasons. Key results: We found differences in seasonal fGCM concentrations, with a 42% increase during the dry season, and no differences in fGCM concentrations between the high and low poaching areas. Additionally, we found fGCM concentrations in samples from the small parks were respectively 38% and 42% higher than in samples from the large park during both the dry and wet seasons compared. Conclusions: Our results suggest that white rhinos may experience physiological stress in smaller parks, especially during the dry season when resources are limited. Implications: By mitigating stress associated with reduced access to resources and spatial constraints, managers may better promote the viability of large mammals in small protected areas.  © 2023 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

TI  - Small Green Spaces in Dense Cities: An Exploratory Study of Perception and Use in Florence, Italy
AU  - Chiesi, L.

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - This study investigates human perception and use of Small Green Spaces (SGS) in a dense Western city (Florence, Italy). While there is some work on social dynamics in large urban parks, empirical studies of SGS are fewer. The research adopts an exploratory approach with a mixed methods strategy (observation sessions, 50 in-depth interviews, and 430 questionnaires). The analysis is framed within a tripartite model of interaction between people and space as spontaneous appropriation of space through the body, senses, and mind. The analysis of use patterns, practices, and conflicts in SGS illustrates how continuous use and proximity make SGS persistent scenarios of users’ daily life, differently from large city parks. Sociality and restorative opportunities afforded by natural features define users’ experiences and SGS appreciation across genders and age groups. The discussion illustrates how the theoretical constructs of functional indetermination and non-normativity explain users’ perception of SGS as open-ended settings, spared from the extensive compression of publicness and commodification of other public spaces in contemporary cities. Implications of the study outcomes are discussed in relation to social cohesion in open public spaces and with the declining sense of urbanity in large cities. Some indications on design, planning, and management of SGS are also suggested. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the extent to which visual attributes, individually and in combination with restorative components, predict PRP in pocket parks. A questionnaire survey was distributed among 384 visitors of eight pocket parks of District 1 of Tehran. The respondents were randomly selected with the restorative components, PRP, and four visual attributes of pocket parks (coherence, mystery, complexity, legibility) measured. The results showed that among four visual attributes, mystery and complexity appeared to be significant positive predictors of restorative components and PRP. Furthermore, their effect on PRP was partially mediated by the restorative components. The findings also indicated that coherence negatively predicted PRP, while legibility was not a significant predictor of PRP. The results of the present study help the ideas of planners, urban planners, and landscape architects to make good use of and rehabilitate abandoned lands. Indeed, they can use the obtained results to better plan and design such parks based on the visual attributes of pocket parks effective in reducing mental fatigue. © 2022 Journal of Urban and Environmental Engineering (JUEE).

AB  - Tokyo is characterized by scattered productive urban landscapes (PULs), such as farmlands, homestead woodlands, and satoyama woodlands, which could potentially promote residents’ physical activity against the backdrop of an aging society. We evaluated the contribution of five types of activities conducted in such locations to promote physical activity in 80 participants through data from accelerometers and activity diaries. Older participants engaged in the activities frequently and for long hours, as well as spent a high percentage of their total energy expenditure on these activities. In particular, energy expenditure in satoyama woodlands averaged approximately-one-third of the national weekly recommendations for older adults. The activities at the allotments varied widely among participants in terms of frequency, activity hours, and energy expenditure, which is desirable because it allows participants to remain involved even when they are older. The results of the generalized linear mixed models showed that total daily energy expenditure was significantly higher on workdays, ranging from 1.18 to 1.36 times of non-workdays by type of activity. The hourly energy expenditure in PULs was comparable to that in public parks, compensating for the small park area in Tokyo, even though it ranged from the highest at homestead woodlands to the lowest at satoyama woodlands. Local governments that wish to support public health and conservation of urban green spaces could encourage residents to use PULs that remain within urban areas. In aging and shrinking cities, they could gain the same benefits by converting poorly managed land to PULs. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Leveraging built environment interventions to equitably promote health during and after COVID-19 in Toronto, Canada
AU  - Hassen, N.
T2  - Health Promotion International
AB  - A key public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic is the mandate to stay home and practice physical distancing. In Canada, with essential activities such as grocery shopping, outdoor exercise and transportation, people need to be able to safely navigate dense, urban spaces while staying at least two metres or six feet apart. This pandemic has exacerbated the health inequities across neighbourhoods in cities like Toronto, Canada which are often segregated along racial and income lines. These inequities impact who has access to urban infrastructure that promotes health and quality of life. Safety in a time of COVID-19 goes beyond just exposure to the virus, it is complicated by notions of who belongs where, and who has access to what resources. The built environment has a role in maintaining and promoting physical and mental health during this pandemic and beyond it. This paper puts forwards three considerations for built environment interventions to promote health equitably: (i) addressing structural determinants of health and embedding anti-racist intersectional principles, (ii) revisiting tactical urbanism as a health promotion tool and (iii) rethinking community engagement processes through equity-based placemaking. This paper outlines four built environment interventions in Toronto, Canada that seek to address the challenges in navigating urban space safely in the short term, including street design that prioritizes pedestrians, protected cycling infrastructure, access to inclusive green space and safe, affordable housing. Longer-term strategies to create health-promoting urban environments that are equitable are discussed and may be valuable to other cities with similar urban equity concerns.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AU  - Hajna, S.
AU  - Nafilyan, V.
AU  - Cummins, S.
T2  - Lancet (London, England)
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urban greenspaces might reduce non-communicable disease risk. The links between greenspaces and mortality related to non-communicable disease remain unclear. We estimated the associations between residential greenspace quantity and access with all-cause, cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory, and type 2 diabetes mortality. METHODS: We linked 2011 UK Census data of London-dwelling adults (aged ≥18 years) to data from the UK death registry and the Greenspace Information for Greater London resource (N=4 645 581). We calculated percent greenspace area, access point density (access points per km2), and distance (metres) to the nearest access point for each respondent's residential neighbourhood (defined as 1000-m street network buffers) for greenspaces overall and by park type using a geographic information system. We estimated associations using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for a range of confounders. Ethics approval was granted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's Observational/Interventions Research Ethics Committee. FINDINGS: Respondents were followed for 8·4 years (SD 1·4). A one percentage point increase in pocket park area was associated with a 6% decrease in all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0·94 [95% CI 0·92-0·97]) and an increase of ten pocket park access points per km2 was associated with an 8% decreased respiratory mortality risk (0·92 [0·85-0·99]). Other associations were observed but the estimated effects were 3% or less. For example, all-cause mortality risk for increases of one percentage point in regional park area (0·99 [0·99-1·00]) and increases of ten small open space access points per km2 (1·03 [1·02-1·03]). INTERPRETATION: Increasing pocket park quantity and access might mitigate premature mortality risk. More research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that could explain these associations.

TI  - The Economic Value of Health Benefits Associated with Urban Park Investment
AU  - Wilson, J.

T2  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
AB  - The allocation of resources towards the development and enhancement of urban parks offers an effective strategy for promoting and improving the health and well-being of urban populations. Investments in urban parks can result in a multitude of health benefits. The increased usage of greenspace by park users has been linked to positive physical and mental health outcomes. Additionally, the expansion of greenspace in urban areas can mitigate harmful impacts from air pollutants, heat, noise, and climate-related health risks. While the health benefits attributed to urban parks and greenspaces are well documented, few studies have measured the economic value of these benefits. This study applied a novel ecohealth economic valuation framework to quantify and estimate the potential economic value of health benefits attributed to the development of a proposed park in the downtown core of Peterborough, Canada. The results indicated that development of the small urban park will result in annual benefits of CAD 133,000 per year, including CAD 109,877 in the avoided economic burden of physical inactivity, CAD 23,084 in health savings associated with improved mental health, and CAD 127 in health savings attributed to better air quality. When including the economic value of higher life satisfaction, the economic benefit is more than CAD 4 million per year. The study demonstrates the value of developing and enhancing urban parks as a strategy to improve population health and well-being, and as a means of cost savings to the medical system. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - It is beneficial to a person’s physical and mental health to engage in regular physical activity, while public parks are a critical infrastructure for encouraging physical activity. However, little research has examined how parks’ and users’ characteristics affect activity intensity. Using primary data collected from 432 users of six public parks of different sizes in Bangkok, this study examined the relationship between park and user characteristics and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to understand the user profile and usage of the parks. Logistic regression was employed to determine the association between MVPA and the characteristics of parks and park users. The results show that MVPA was positively influenced by gender (being male with MVPA of 29.0%), time spent in the parks (MVPA of 22.7%), weekend evenings by 21.6%, large park size by 18.9%, and availability of park facilities by 233.0%. However, age, marital status, and occupation did not influence MVPA. Our findings indicate that the improvement of park facilities and enlargement of park size can increase MVPA for various ages and genders. Furthermore, improving facilities in small parks, raising local awareness, and disseminating information about parks can boost MVPA. © 2023 by the authors.

AU  - Kyrönviita, M.
AU  - Wallin, A.
T2  - City
AB  - In recent years, informal and unauthorised amateur urban design solutions have become an urban trend in the global North. These Do-It-Yourself (DIY) urbanism actions can be playful commentaries, critical interventions or functional improvements to urban spaces. In general, DIY urbanism tries to make urban everyday life better, but it is not always considered a political act. This paper presents an ethnographic case study of a DIY skatepark building in Tampere, Finland, and describes a group of skaters’ political subjectivisation and how they learned hands-on to influence urban governance. After the city’s failed skatepark plan, the skaters turned their discontent into a tactical spatial appropriation, a DIY skatepark, and later shifted their mode of politics to strategic claim-making. By doing so, the skaters became not only skilled skatepark builders, but also an organised association promoting skateboarding and influencing urban development and culture. This paper argues that DIY urbanism has transformative potential to act as a catalyst for bottom-up change in a contemporary city. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Guerrilla gardening as normalised law-breaking: Challenges to land ownership and aesthetic order
AU  - Millie, A.
T2  - Crime, Media, Culture
AB  - This article considers guerrilla gardening that involves taking on other people’s land for gardening, usually without their permission. It is a practice that is overlooked largely by criminology, yet it can tell us something about attitudes to law and land ownership and challenges the approved aesthetic order of where we live. It can soften the look and feel of the city, leading to a different emotional and affective interaction with urbanity. Evidence is presented from a qualitative study of guerrilla gardeners from the North West of England. The discussion is informed theoretically by work on aesthetic criminology, do-it-yourself and temporary urbanism and the idea of urban commons. In this study, guerrilla gardening is found to be a normalised form of law-breaking that, despite not necessarily being to everyone’s taste and the gardeners having an autocratic view of property, is a form of urban intervention that is broadly accepted and welcomed, even by those who enforce the law. © The Author(s) 2022.

TI  - Exploring traffic evaporation: Findings from tactical urbanism interventions in Barcelona
AU  - Nello-Deakin, S.
T2  - Case Studies on Transport Policy
AB  - Traffic evaporation – i.e. the opposite of induced traffic – is acknowledged as a well-established phenomenon which presents important implications for local urbanism and mobility policies, but there continue to be few academic studies which explore this issue in detail. This paper explores relative levels of traffic evaporation following the implementation of multiple tactical urbanism interventions on 11 streets in Barcelona in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the analysis of publicly available traffic count data, the findings provide empirical support for the existence of significant levels of traffic evaporation following road space reduction. On average, traffic levels on streets with interventions diminished by −14.8 % relative to streets in the rest of the city. In the wider vicinity of intervention streets, traffic levels also decreased slightly on average (−0.9 %) compared to the rest of the city, except on immediately adjacent parallel streets to those affected by interventions, which reported a small relative traffic increase (+0.7 %). Overall, these findings provide further support for street redesign policies which entail the reduction of road space for motor vehicles, and suggest that fears of traffic congestion following such schemes may often be unfounded. From a methodological standpoint, this study also offers a transparent method of evaluating traffic evaporation which could be replicated in future studies. © 2022 World Conference on Transport Research Society

TI  - Exploring the need for innovation in greening urban environments: Reflecting on radical practice in Greater Manchester, UK

T2  - Cogent Social Sciences
AB  - The green agenda is high on the list of priorities of local, national, and global governments. In the UK, a new £40 million scheme aims to encourage a sustainable recovery alongside policies—such as the 25 Year Environment Plan—and other tools pushing more investment into the area. With this push, we are now seeing innovation in urban green infrastructure: from pocket parks, to Americanised models of community gardens both becoming more frequent across our cityscapes. This paper critically explores the rise of “radical sustainability” and the need to embrace new forms of urban green infrastructure. The focus of the paper is explicitly on enabling urban food growing in cities. We begin with an overview of the practice before proceeding to review current policy tools and, finally, reflecting on a case study in Salford. With the latter, we reflect on a model which enables larger-scale farming in the heart of one of the region’s most deprived areas. We present a case study of a multifunctional forest school in Salford, reflecting on our work in enabling the project, along its potential impacts. The multidisciplinary team, formed of an urban geographer, a contextual studies scholar, and an illustrator, present a visual methodology framework which could be replicated in future studies. In this sense, we also reflect on the use of methodologies in allowing for radical visions to be constructed and enabled within the planning system. The paper demonstrates the transformative nature of innovative greening schemes and calls for more funding to push forward the practice in the UK and beyond. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Heat wave episodes are becoming more frequent and severe worldwide, especially in areas such as the Mediterranean region. This study is aimed at assessing the impact of heat waves in an urban environment and the ways areas of urban green infrastructure (UGI) can play key roles in moderating the impacts of these high-temperature events. We analyzed land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data retrieved from Landsat 8/9 satellite images. These data were recorded during heat wave episodes from 2017 to 2022 in a representative Mediterranean medium-sized compact city. We carried out a correlation analysis between LST and NDVI per area type and as individual units to assess how UGI elements can contribute to the cooling of the urban matrix during heat wave episodes. Those small green spaces distributed throughout the city, defined as “Other” areas, showed stronger negative correlation. These spaces are particularly relevant for Mediterranean cities, where highly limited space in city centers hinders the possibility of having larger-surface UGI elements. The study highlights the need for further research into the composition of those small public green spaces to understand how their components enhance the city’s cooling capacity given the climate conditions and water scarcity in the Mediterranean region. © 2023 by the authors.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - The literature to date has mainly explored the impact on public mental health of green spaces around residential areas, large urban parks, family gardens, blue spaces, national parks, etc., while few studies have examined the association of Small Urban Green Spaces (SUGS) with public mental health. The role, function, and service radius of SUGS in urban people's lives are quite different from those of general green spaces, and the relationship and mechanism linking general green spaces to mental health cannot be fully applied to small parks. This work was conducted to: 1) investigate the relationship between SUGS and mental health; 2) understand what factors affect mental health; 3) determine what kind of SUGS is more conducive to improving mental health. SUGS’ designs and physical characteristics were evaluated with the Natural Environment Scoring Tool (NEST) and user information for 10 SUGS (1–5 ha) in Shanghai in 2021 was collected via a questionnaire. We developed a multilevel model for exploring the factors affecting mental health from two aspects: the individual level and the park level. This study found that SUGS and mental health were positively associated. In addition to individual–level variables like income, marital status, social cohesion, and use frequency, park–level variables such as usability, aesthetics–natural features, and civilized environment are also conducive to improving mental health, while entertainment facilities in SUGS have a negative association with mental health. There was no evidence that visit frequency, stay time, social cohesion, or physical exercise act as a mediator between park features and mental health. This study provides empirical evidence for the positive correlation between SUGS and mental health and presents a means of promoting public mental health with efficient SUGS planning and management. © 2022

TI  - Coupling Coordination between Park Green Space (PGS) and Socioeconomic Deprivation (SED) in High-Density City Based on Multi-Scale: From Environmental Justice Perspective
AU  - Huang, S.

AB  - Several studies have revealed that park green space (PGS) plays a crucial role in improving residents’ quality of life and promoting sustainable development of the environment. However, rapid urbanization and population growth have led to an inequitable supply and demand for PGS, especially in high-density cities, which has been widely recognized as an important environmental justice issue. However, few studies have evaluated the equity and sustainability of PGS in high-density cities based on multi-scale. This study developed a framework to explore the spatial equity of PGS and its coupling coordination degree (CCD) with socioeconomic deprivation (SED) based on a multi-scale approach (pocket park, community park, and comprehensive park), then analyzed the spatial correlation between PGS and CCD. The results showed that: (1) The overall supply of 3-scale PGS does not meet residents’ demand for PGS resources in the study area and the urban center has the highest demand for PGS. (2) Among the three-scale PGS, the comprehensive PGS has the strongest supply capacity, but it also has the most severe supply–demand mismatch. (3) Although the service radius of pocket PGS is smaller than that of community PGS, the supply of pocket PGS is higher. (4) More than 95% of the studied area lacks coordination between PGS and SED development. (5) The subsystem that has the greatest spatial correlation with CCD in pocket PGS and comprehensive PGS was the number of configurations, while that in community PGS was the spatial arrangement. This study not only provides a theoretical reference for conducting research on PGS equity in high-density cities, but also provides a novel perspective on the sustainable, coordinated development and planning of urban PGS system. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Urban bird diversity: does abundance and richness vary unexpectedly with green space attributes?
AU  - Thompson, R.

T2  - Journal of Urban Ecology
AB  - Urban bird diversity has been shown to be a useful indicator of overall biodiversity in urban green spaces. Attributes of green spaces (size, location and age) vary within a city and can influence bird diversity. To understand the relationship between bird diversity and green space attributes, we assessed bird abundance and richness in several green spaces in Reykjavik, Iceland. Fifteen green spaces were selected, representing different size categories (small: <5 ha and large: 7-41 ha) and different locations within the urban sprawl (central and suburban). Thirteen transect surveys were conducted at each park from March to September 2020. Abundance, species richness, the Shannon diversity index and evenness were compared across parks. Abundance, Shannon index and evenness were significantly higher in large, intermediate-aged parks with residential urban contexts (P < 0.05). Richness did not vary significantly with park size but was significantly higher in old- and intermediate-age parks that were centrally located (P < 0.005). Bird diversity did not vary significantly over the survey season. For abundance, our results were expected: the larger the park, the greater the abundance. However, contrary to most studies, the suburbs of Reykjavik had less richness than the city center. Furthermore, park size was not relevant for richness, which is the main factor in other cities (e.g. London, Boston). These differences in response indicate that abundance and richness should be considered simultaneously when monitoring urban bird diversity. Lastly, small urban parks (<5 ha) should not be disregarded in urban planning, especially in high latitude cities.  © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

TI  - The Grass is Always Greener: Analyzing Crime Concentration and Specialization in Urban Greenspace Environs
AU  - Hodgen, C.

T2  - Criminology, Criminal Justice, Law and Society
AB  - Greenspaces play an important role in the urban landscape, with prior research suggesting that they are associated with numerous health and social benefits for residents. Despite this, research conflicts regarding the relationship between greenspaces and crime, with some studies finding these locations to be criminogenic and others finding them to be protective against local crime. This study examines this relationship in Portland, Oregon, considering different greenspace types as well as different crime types. Further, this study presents a novel methodological adaption to measure crime concentration and specialization around discrete location types by integrating a street network buffer into the standard Location Quotient (LQ) metric. Results suggest that Portland’s greenspaces as a whole do not experience a concentration of crime; however, varying patterns emerge when examining different greenspace and crime types. This study identifies diverse crime concentrations in proximity to small parks, while finding other greenspace categories to be associated with crime-specific concentrations nearby. Others, still, have lower than expected counts of crime concentrating nearby, potentially demonstrating protective trends. These results highlight the importance of disaggregating both crime and location types to better understand the complex relationship between greenspaces and crime. © 2023 Criminology, Criminal Justice, Law & Society and The Western Society of Criminology Hosting by Scholastica.

AB  - Pocket-sized urban parks may contribute to more widely distributing the advantages created by parks in urban neighborhoods, allowing more citizens to benefit more frequently from park environments. Notwithstanding their several benefits, including citizens’ psychological, physiological and physical well-being; possibilities for recreational activities; and improved economic attractiveness of a neighborhood, pocket parks (PPs) are not yet widely diffused worldwide. Considering the state of the art of PPs, we identify four main perspectives that characterize them: architectural, microclimate, managerial and legal. Focusing on a relevant case study, i.e., the Mediterranean context, we analyze the multi-disciplinary challenges – connected to the four identified dimensions – for their diffusion elsewhere. Finally, we provide a general framework for favoring PPs’ creation and management, as the original contribution of this work. Besides advancing scientific knowledge about PPs, our results also interest policymakers and public organizations, as the diffusion of PPs can mitigate urban environmental challenges by creating pleasant experiences for citizens and favoring economic activities. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Climate change can cause multiply potential health issues in urban areas, which is the most susceptible environment in terms of the presently increasing climate volatility. Urban greening strategies make an important part of the adaptation strategies which can ameliorate the negative impacts of climate change. It was aimed to study the potential impacts of different kinds of greenings against the adverse effects of climate change, including waterborne, vector-borne diseases, heat-related mortality, and surface ozone concentration in a medium-sized Hungarian city. As greening strategies, large and pocket parks were considered, based on our novel location identifier algorithm for climate risk minimization. A method based on publicly available data sources including satellite pictures, climate scenarios and urban macrostructure has been developed to evaluate the health-related indicator patterns in cities. The modelled future- and current patterns of the indicators have been compared. The results can help the understanding of the possible future state of the studied indicators and the development of adequate greening strategies. Another outcome of the study is that it is not the type of health indicator but its climate sensitivity that determines the extent to which it responds to temperature rises and how effective greening strategies are in addressing the expected problem posed by the factor. © 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - Effect of Environmental Planning on Elderly Individual Quality of Life in Severe Cold Regions: A Case Study in Northeastern China
AU  - Leng, H.
AU  - Han, B.
T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - With the development of urbanization and the ageing population, the improvement of the urban environment and the quality of life (QOL) of the elderly in cities with a cold climate have become critical issues to be addressed. However, only a few studies have focused on this aspect. According to a review of the literature, the contents of the built environment (BE) in severe cold regions are defined as thirteen key factors of four categories (density, environmental aesthetics, outdoor environment, and accessibility) and the QOL of old people consists of three aspects (residential, health, and social satisfaction). This study explores how BE variables are associated with the QOL of older adults by using ordered logit and gologit2 models. The data consist of the results of 1945 ques-tionnaires from field surveys in 11 different residential areas, across two cities in northeastern China. The results show: (1) Walkability in winter, distance to a public park of 400–1000 m, outdoor shelters and seating, less than five buses available, and a mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees are five of the most important variables of BE that have a significant positive impact on QOL compared with other climatic regions; (2) “Pocket parks” and pedestrian walkway safety are appropriate approaches to improve wellbeing under local economic conditions. For public transportation, metro and rail transit systems are encouraged, and some rules are needed to reduce the number of buses in harsh weather conditions; (3) Compared with spatial distribution in other climates, the scope of a 15 min city should be less than 1km in severe cold areas. From the findings, we conclude that there are six possible pattern languages to improve the urban environment, and they can provide information for further study on environmental planning in severe cold regions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Nowadays, pocket parks can serve people's interests as outdoor recreational spaces. Existence of these spaces is essential, but it may be challenging to establish and maintain them in some neighborhoods for a variety of reasons. This study aimed to compare land use and accessibility as two main factors that affect choosing appropriate places for these mini-parks. For this purpose, we assessed the effect of these variables on public presence. A survey was conducted among N = 376 respondents, including Baharestan neighborhood residents. We also used Space syntax to investigate residents' access to green local space. The results indicated that the effects that location had concerning packet parks greatly overshadowed the effects of accessibility. It was additionally concluded that, the different types of commercial land use are more closely associated with people's attendance rather than the scale of land use. The findings will help urban planners and authorities to make better decisions towards choosing better pocket park locations in our cities. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - The resurgence of urban foraging under COVID-19
AU  - Clouse, C.
T2  - Landscape Research
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic exposed cracks in American food security, as global supply chains seised, movement within cities and regions halted, and restaurant access diminished. During this time, new interest in local food provisioning surfaced in the US, highlighting the value of productive agriculture within urban landscapes. In many areas, this urban food provisioning expanded to include foraging, the practice of acquiring food products from edible landscapes for free. This paper charts the resurgence of urban foraging during the pandemic, frames this activity within theory on do-it-yourself (DIY) urbanism and the right to the city, and makes planning and design recommendations for bolstering this trend in the future. While urban foraging has historically been characterised by bottom-up participation, the addition of top-down organisational frameworks and legal structures could reinforce this practice in North America, helping to promote local food security, particularly during periods of crisis. © 2022 Landscape Research Group Ltd.

AB  - Many scholars have focused on Satoyama, which is characterized by mountains or villages away from the urban spaces. Our objective is to verify its psychophysiological effects on people performing usual Satoyama activities in ignored, small urban green spaces to help people find ways to stay healthy in post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) society. In this study, 12 older adult volunteers from the “Forest around the Mountains” Nonprofit Organization and 12 young people from the university were invited as study subjects. They were asked to observe nature for 10 min and work for 30 min in the small green space “Forest around the Mountains”. The Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition (POMS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventor (STAI) were used as psychological scales to detect their psychological restoration and blood pressure before and after the Satoyama activity. Their heart rate during the activity was used as the physiological indicator. The study showed that, as Satoyama volunteers, the older adults group had significant restorative psychophysiological effects during this experiment compared to the younger group; their systolic and diastolic blood pressure dropped significantly after Satoyama activities, On the other hand, the young group have been in the normotensive range before or after Satoyama activities The psychological indicators such as Anger-hostility, Confusion-bewilderment, and Tension-anxiety were significantly lower in the younger group but were still significantly higher than the indicators of the older adults. In general, this study found that Satoyama activities benefited young and older participants, especially older adults with high blood pressure. Satoyama activities in small urban green spaces are thus necessary and worth promoting in the post-COVID-19 era. © 2022 by the authors.

T2  - Building and Environment
AB  - This study set out to understand the dynamics of human thermal sensation and perception associated with outdoor thermal variability in urban contexts. Previous studies found that compact urban forms and green features can contribute to urban climate diversity, and conjectured whether the wax and wane of thermal stress can promote thermal satisfaction in outdoor public spaces. Hence, a stop-and-go method has been developed to accurately capture thermal transitions along urban walks and to provide snapshots of the momentary body thermal sensation and subjective thermal perception. The measurement campaigns carried in late summer involved a total of 40 participants walking for 70 min through two waterfront districts in Rome, Italy. Our findings indicate that: (1) the oscillation of air temperature along the dense urban walk (R2=0.74) is nearly twice as frequent as that along the sparse suburban walk (R2=0.23), due to the microclimatic diversity shaped by the compact urban fabrics, pocket parks and tree-lined river banks; (2) the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) contrast can effectively predict thermal alliesthesia (R2=0.34) measured by the rate of change of mean skin temperature (d(Tmskin)/dt < 0.012°C∙min−1); (3) subjective perception shows a significant trend but a poorer model fit (R2<0.25) predicted by UTCI and Tmskin; (4) two confounders, view and social backgrounds, are proved to affect the regression model between the objective and subjective data. The conclusions emphasise the importance of incorporating spatial and social contexts into the investigation of outdoor thermal comfort via physiological and psychological approaches. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Work and life stresses can cause spiritual fatigue and emotional tension, threatening the physical and psychological health of young people. Several studies have demonstrated the important role and value of pocket parks in the emotional and spiritual refreshment of people. This study quantitatively evaluated the perceived restorative effects associated with the environmental characteristics of a pocket park, and determined the relationships between the physical-environmental characteristics, psychological-environmental characteristics and the restorative effects. In this study, pocket parks in Chongqing City were chosen as the study areas, and a total of 25 sample pictures of the parks were chosen for analysis. Each picture was quantized into 14 physical-environmental indices and three psychological-environmental indices for measurement of the restorative effect. The results showed that the environmental characteristics of parks with a restorative effect include naturality, sense of distance, charm and privacy. The physical-environmental characteristics related to young people’s restoration and their degree of influence were determined through quantitative analysis. Moreover, a prediction model of the environmental restoration effect of pocket parks was established. The research conclusions can provide a reference for the evaluation and comparison of the environmental restoration performance of pocket parks and the design of restorative pocket parks. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Behaviour observation and mapping are useful planning tools to generate evidence to create people-friendly public spaces. Small-scale interventions are gaining popularity as cost-effective and quick solutions to regenerate degraded urban outdoor environments. Onsite behaviour observation mapping with GIS underpins evidence gathering, analysis, and planning and design decision-making. Using the BlueHealth Behaviour Assessment Tool (BBAT) developed within the EU-funded Horizon 2020 Project “Blue Health”, we carried out pre- and post- intervention observations of visits, activities and visitors' characteristics in a site at Teats Hill, Plymouth, United Kingdom. Pre-post comparison of visits and activities in three target areas the entire site before and the within-site intervention area (a small open-air theatre) and the rest of the site afterwards were examined to analyse the impact of the intervention on socialising and relaxing activities. Behaviour observation data was both spatially and statistically analysed. Key outcomes were sitting, standing, walking, activity with a dog, viewing, using a phone and socialising. Both a logistic regression model and spatial analysis using density maps and hot spot analysis confirmed an increased use of the open-air theatre and its positive impact on the use of the rest of the park (the non-intervention area). Our logit models showed that the intervention promoted positive behaviour for health (i.e. blue space activities, socialisation, and relaxing activities), greater inclusivity and diversity of visitors. We conclude that an evidence-based design approach can increase blue space accessibility, improve place affordances and promote positive behaviour and psychological well-being benefitting local communities. © 2023 The Authors

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - Urban green infrastructures play a critical role in enhancing the well-being of residents, yet their equitable access remains a concern, particularly during the COVID-19 outbreak. There is a lack of knowledge on how people respond to the pandemic regarding the usage of green infrastructure in cities. This paper explores the shifts in visitation to parks and trails, two popular types of green infrastructures in Salt Lake County, Utah, by analyzing the results of a survey conducted during the pandemic. Our conceptualization considers personal and neighborhood level factors, including personal socioeconomic status, existing inequalities of green infrastructures, urban form, and neighborhood conditions. People who reside close to the city center tend to go to parks more often, while those living in urban edges use trails more. Visiting green infrastructures less often is more likely in areas with higher COVID-19 infection rates. The regression results confirm the importance of neighborhood level factors and illustrate the intricate elements influencing people's decisions to visit different green infrastructures during the pandemic, which shows non-linear relationships. Wealthier, white, and younger people seem to enjoy green infrastructures more often, leading to the concern of amplified inequality. Higher COVID-19 cases result in higher demands for green infrastructures, which are not fulfilled during the pandemic, especially for vulnerable communities, leading to spatial exclusion. The findings highlight the importance of smart growth, including compact development, public transit, and pocket parks, in promoting the urban resilience of park and trail visits, as they may provide more opportunities for access and alternatives to green infrastructures even in the context of the pandemic. © 2023

AB  - The smaller size of mini-parks in relation to conventional parks makes them a flexible and adaptable greening option for high-density neighbourhoods, despite limiting their individual service capacity. Consequently, some densely populated cities have developed clusters of mini-parks to meet intense recreational demands. We endeavoured to study the factors that support visits to mini-park groups, rather than to individual parks, taking 106 mini-park groups within Nanjing as samples. We utilised Tencent user density (TUD) data to trace the visit intensity of these groups and integrated multi-source data to measure their internal and external features. By establishing a regression model series, we investigated how the mini-park groups' internal amenities, proximity to surrounding recreation-related facilities, neighbourhood features, and layout affected their visit intensity over time (day/night, week/weekend). The results showed that larger open sites, proximate restaurants, higher density of commerce, offices and residents, and higher housing prices promoted visits, whereas greater neighbourhood green coverage discouraged visits. We also found that the service provision of most mini-park groups in Nanjing was inefficient or unbalanced, and that most mini-parks within a group worked competitively rather than complementarily. These findings can inform future decision making and mini-park planning in Nanjing and similar cities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Environmental color interventions on a macro scale: Tactical urbanism and issues of global concern
AU  - O'Connor, Z.
T2  - Color Research and Application
AB  - Color is a common design element in the built environment and is considered to have the capacity to elicit human response. In respect to environmental color interventions, outcomes tend to occur on a localized, microscale and relate to improving visual amenity, enhancing engagement and activation, and supporting initiatives relating to environmental visual literacy, wayfinding, orientation, and cultural diversity. Recently, a new type of color intervention has emerged. Relating to geopolitical issues of global concern, these occur on a “pop-up” basis, carry a sense of immediacy, and relate to specific issues on a broader, crosscultural, macro scale. Falling under the category of tactical urbanism and representing a new form of environmental color intervention, this article identifies and documents two such interventions, both of which feature color as an integral element. In doing so, a secondary aim was to discuss the likely intended outcomes of these interventions. Adopting a case study methodology in tandem with a grounded theory qualitative approach, this investigation represents insight into this new form of environmental color intervention. Outcomes indicate that these interventions focus on communicating information aimed at initiating change on a global, macro scale. Future research will indicate the extent to which these aims are met. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

TI  - The Utilization of the WMO-1234 Guidance to Improve Citizen’s Wellness and Health: An Italian Perspective

AB  - In 2019, the World Meteorological Organization published its “Guidance on Integrated Urban Hydrometeorological, Climate and Environment Services (Volume I: Concept and Methodology)” to assist WMO Members in developing and implementing the urban services that address the needs of city stakeholders in their countries. The guidance has relevant implications for not only protecting infrastructures from the impacts of climate change in the urban environment, but its proper declination strongly supports health-related policies to protect the population from direct and indirect impacts. Utilizing some principles of the guidance, the urbanized area of Bologna (Italy) was analyzed in order to furnish the municipality with tools coherent with the best practices actually emerging from the international bibliography to protect the citizens’ health of this city. Specifically, the analysis concentrated on the public spaces and the potential vulnerabilities of the fragile population to high-temperature regimes in the city. Utilizing the guidance as a methodological framework, the authors developed a methodology to define the microclimate vulnerabilities of the city and specific cards to assist the policymakers in city regeneration. Because the medieval structure of the city does not allow the application of a wide set of nature-based solutions, our main attention was placed on the possibility of furnishing the city with a great number of pocket parks obtainable from spaces actually dedicated to parking lots, thus introducing new green infrastructures in a highly deprived area in order to assure safety spaces for the fragile population. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The contradiction between the shortage of urban land and the demand for urban green space needs to be solved reasonably. Different from urban parks, the cooling effect of small green space (SGs) has not been paid enough attention or fully evaluated. The major objective of this research was to explore the cooling and energy saving benefits of SGs with administrative units. The ENVI-met and EnergyPlus models were built based on field measurements on the green space of Xi’an Jiaotong University Qujiang Campus. Field measurement shows that the closer an area to the green space, the lower the air temperature and the higher the relative humidity, especially in the daytime. The ENVI-met results showed that the SGs can reduce the temperature by 0.66 °C within the range of 1260 m × 1350 m compared with the building scene at noon, the EnergyPlus simulation results showed that the building 100 m away from the SGs can reduce the air conditioning energy consumption by 2.1% compared with the distance of 150 m. The research can improve the planning and design standards of urban green space, clarify the cooling and energy saving benefits of SGs, and promote the ecological urban design. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - There are only few studies globally that have documented the linkages between urban green spaces (UGS) and sustainable development goals (SDGs). In Malaysia, there is no existing research evaluating the relationship between UGS and SDGs. In this study, we assessed Malaysians’ perception on the association between UGS and seven selected SDGs, building on existing studies that looked at importance of UGS with regards to biodiversity, health, and wellbeing outcomes in Malaysia. Using an online survey of 645 respondents across Malaysia, we tested two hypotheses: H1) perception of SDGs varies by socio-demographic factors and H2) perception of SDGs is moderated by distance to green spaces. A pre-tested structured online questionnaire was administered using a 5-point Likert scale. The data was then analysed using analysis of variance and ordinary least squares. Results show that there is an overall statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between the sociodemographic variables and the positive perceptions of seven selected SDGs. Several sociodemographic factors (female, younger age, university education, closer to UGS, physical activities in UGS) had positive and significant relationship between UGS and SDGs perception. However, proximity to UGS did not moderate the effect of demographic factors on the attitude towards the SDGs. As Malaysia is becoming a rapidly urbanized country, we suggest developing small green spaces (e. g. pocket parks) in the vicinity of housing areas so that people will have easy access and perform physical activities for their wellbeing. At the same time these green spaces will ultimately contribute to achieving other SDGs in urban areas. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Urban parks reduce air temperatures within parks and surroundings by exerting the cooling island effect, significant for mitigating the urban microclimate. However, the park cooling effect may be influenced by the surrounding building configuration, and this needs to be studied in more detail, in particular, to explore how to maximize the cooling effect of parks by adjusting the surrounding building configuration. Thus, in this study, the effects of building height, building interval, and building orientation on the cooling effect of a small urban park were investigated using field measurements and ENVI-met numerical simulations. The results demonstrated that (1) building height, building interval, and building orientation all impact the park cooling effect, but their impacts vary. (2) Building height had the strongest effect on the park cooling intensity, and adjusting building height provided the maximum park cooling intensity (1.2 °C). (3) Building orientation had the most effect on the park cooling distance, 100 m downwind of the park. (4) The park cooling effect is best when the surrounding buildings were parallel to the prevailing wind direction, and the park cool island has the greatest intensity and range. This study can guide decision-makers in optimizing building configuration to maximize the park cooling effect. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The Innovating Streets for People programme supported street space reallocation to enhance the safety, accessibility, and liveability of streets throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. The programme supported the use of tactical urbanism and co-design practices to more easily and quickly deliver temporary solutions that demonstrate and build support for change, bring forward benefits, and enhance permanent solutions. Innovating Streets for People funding (2020-21) supported the delivery of 62 temporary walking and cycling projects across Aotearoa. Approximately 89km of interim street treatments were delivered, including cycleways, safe crossings, parklets, and traffic calming. A mixed-method evaluation showed that Innovating Streets for People projects can accelerate a range of benefits, including safety and accessibility improvements and more supportive environments for active travel. A focus on continuous improvement, sector capability, and addressing system constraints, is needed to realise further programme potential. How evaluation and practice-based learning from Innovating Streets for People has been integrated within the design of the 2021-24 Streets for People Programme, and how responses are expected to support intended outcomes, are discussed. © The Author(s). 2022 This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited.

AB  - Globally, accelerating urbanization has led to a severe shortage of urban green spaces. This scarcity is particularly acute in inner cities with high population densities and ratios of built-up areas. To explore park visitors’ usage and perceptions, we present the results of a survey of 681 individuals from different socioeconomic groups conducted in four small urban parks in Budapest, Hungary's capital. The survey results found that people living near the block parks were their primary users, but many people from distant areas also visited the parks due to their good accessibility. In addition, findings show that the green components of the parks were generally more satisfactory to users than other amenities, indicating higher quality expectations for cultural ecosystem services in small urban green spaces. However, perceptions of park safety varied across socioeconomic groups, suggesting that views of safety did not necessarily reflect actual park security. Finally, while most respondents stated they would not want to contribute to park maintenance, young people, particularly neighborhood newcomers, showed greater willingness to volunteer for such work. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Supporting services are important services to maintain ecosystems by providing habitats for organisms and genetic diversity. In this study, the monetary value of supporting services for bird habitats in urban parks was evaluated based on the price for nursing each bird species and market value. Bird diversity was conducted using point count observation. We found total of 53 bird species, 27 families and 8 orders in the park. Total monetary benefit for bird habitats in this park was estimated to be around USD60,354.12 per individual bird with an average value of USD1,138.76 per bird per species. The top three species with the highest monetary value were the Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala), Asian Openbill (Anastomus oscitans), and Chinese Pond Heron (Ardeola bacchus). The species diversity index of the bird community (H') was 2.73 and the most abundant bird species were Eastern Spotted Dove (Spilopelia chinensis), Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), Eastern jungle crow (Corvus levaillantii), Oriental magpie robin (Copsychus saularis), and Coppersmith Barbet (Psilopogon haemacephalus). Among 4 microhabitats, birds were found the most in the trees, followed by lawn, grassland, and wetland areas. The small urban parks should be designed with diverse microhabitats to provide various ecological functions to attract and ensure adequate resources for organisms. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - In the last decades, the emergence of new social, environmental, and economic demands, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has led urban planning to innovate its themes, methods, and approaches. In this context, temporary urbanism has emerged as a mainstream approach. How-ever, the impacts of temporary approaches to urban planning are far from being fully understood. In this light, this study focuses on one of the mainstream approaches to temporary urbanism, tactical urbanism, and tries to understand its economic impacts on contemporary cities. Indeed, despite the growing interest in tactical urbanism interventions and their value as an urban regeneration tool, there are no specific reflections focused on investigating their economic effects. Based on these premises, this paper focuses on different tactical urbanism experiences in the Italian context and tries to assess the economic impacts of tactical urbanism interventions by adopting the lens of real estate values as a suitable proxy when dealing with urban environments. The first obtained results show that the experiences of tactical urbanism, partly because of their temporary nature and their tendency toward minimal intervention, fail to trigger regeneration processes or produce significant economic impacts on the territory. Instead, such experiences can play a role in accelerating or consolidating urban regeneration processes already underway, and, in this sense, they contribute to the generation of economic impact on the territory. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This research article aimed to classify parks and propose guidelines for developing parks based on the criteria, standards and measures of urban planning, which is consistent with the development of all park areas in Samutsakhon Municipality and Banphaeo Sub-district Municipality in Samut Sakhon Province. The research tools used were questionnaires (given to 722 people) and interview forms (two representatives of the municipal offices and two urban planning experts). According to the research findings, Samutsakhon Municipality has many types of parks, including pocket parks, community parks, street parks, and special-purpose parks. Further, there are four park areas with open space for recreation and conservation of environmental quality according to the general planning enforcement announcement. As a result, the radius of service for the parks is able to gratify people in the areas thoroughly based on the standards of the Department of Public Works and Town & Country Planning. For park area development in the future, negative measures and incentive measures should be considered to improve the park area management. In Banphaeo Sub-district Municipality, most of the parks are pocket parks; none exceeds 0.0032 square kilometers in size, which cannot be compared with the standards of the Department of Public Works and Town & Country Planning. Moreover, the type of open space used for recreation and environmental conservation has not been found in the general urban planning enforcement announcement. The development of park areas in the future should take into account negative and incentive measures to increase the size of park areas. © 2022 Kasetsart University.

AU  - Fayyaz, M.

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has the potential to drastically change society and the way we understand, plan and design cities and regions, just as automobiles did a century ago. In the current context of climate change, sustainable urban environments based on active mobility (walking and cycling), urban proximity and green spaces, are increasingly in demand, leading to the emergence of new interventions and urban models. Although these trends may be affected by the arrival of AVs, most decision-makers and planners still do not address these issues in their current planning. This is because of the confusion associated with the diversity of impacts of AVs, but also by the lack of design recommendations and planning tools. To shed light on these aspects, this paper reviews the relationship between mobility and urban public space, the impacts of AVs on urban space and design proposals and strategies aimed at configuring driverless cities, with special focus on street design. The results of the review show that the implementation of AVs can be a great opportunity to liberate urban space and reclaim it for people, in line with new urban models such as the superblocks (Barcelona), the 15-minute city (Paris), or tactical urbanism interventions against COVID-19. However, it may also entail risks such as a reduction in active mobility or public transport use. The magnitude and direction of these impacts will depend on crucial decisions that need to be taken now, such as encouraging shared used over ownership, and establishing citizen-centred urban planning and design objectives and strategies to make AV deployment the most ben-eficial for all. © 2022 by the authors.

T2  - Architecture, City and Environment
AB  - For several decades, the notion of landscape has been instrumentalised by various fields of study and with the most diverse views and interests. This is a notion that brings together all the features of liminal spaces, areas characterised by their mediating nature. The success and rapid extension of the concept of landscape, however, has not yet seen a similar development in the methodological field nor is it achieving sufficient consensus to be applied to the administrative scope. In this contribution we will adjust our reflection around the idea of historic urban landscapes, highlighting the need to address the “change management” approach demanded by 21st-century cities. To this end, we shall delve into some new urban management initiatives, in which the “prosumer citizenship” is beginning to be a key element in the construction of the identity of the spaces inhabited. In the same vein, the scope and content of the emerging discipline of tactical urbanism will also be discussed, paying special attention to the limitations of “design thinking” in historic city centres; areas affected by environments that are frequently problematic, where the complex regulations of-individual or collective-tutelage that cultural assets require come into play. © 2020, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

TI  - Socio-demographic and physical factors influencing access to urban parks in rapidly urbanizing cities of Ethiopia: The case of Addis Ababa
AU  - Azagew, S.

T2  - Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism
AB  - Many studies in developed countries examined the effect of proximity, socio-demographic and individual psychometric factors on urban parks (UPs) access. However, in rapidly urbanizing cities of Africa, access to UPs remains problematic, and yet comparatively little is studied about how these factors may affect park access. This paper investigates the effect of socio-demographic and physical factors on the UPs access and utilization in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The study employed structured questionnaire to collect data from 189 sample park visitors. Besides, descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, chi-square test and multivariate regression were used to analyze the association between variables. The result indicated age, monthly income, occupation, awareness about the parks, distance, traveled time to park, and mode of transport have significant (p < 0.05) association with frequency of park visit. Time limitation and lack of different programs in the parks were also identified as the main constraints that affect park utilization. We concluded that socio-demographic factors such as age, income, occupation, awareness about the parks, physical and some personal constraints as well as lack of diversified programs were the major factors that influence park access and utilization in the study area. Management Implications: This study provides a quantitative analysis of the pattern of UPs use by the city residents, and highlights factors affecting the park access and utilization. Thus, our results imply the following management measures for better future of UPs access and utilization in Addis Ababa: • Provision of accessible and well-maintained parks, especially pocket parks in the neighborhoods is crucial. • Diversification of park programs and consideration of the need and preference of different socio-demographic characteristic during the planning and design of UPs are also important. • Good public transportation system and enough parking lots in the park could attract more park users from distant part of the city. • Awareness creation about the benefits and location of UPs is also very crucial to enhance park utilization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Bike mobilities, democratic revival and the local fix: Valencia, from corruption epicentre to mediterranean cycle capital
AU  - Baron, N.
T2  - BELGEO
AB  - This article explores the local political strategies associated with the implementation of sustainable bike policies in southern European cities. It combines geographical concepts and methods, on the one hand, and sustainable policy studies on the other hand, with the aim of highlighting the specificities of the Mediterranean political context of mobility transition. Using Valencia as a case study, it shows that tactical urbanism is being used to put sustainable mobilities on the local agenda. This justifies and embodies a change in municipal policy and politics after a decade of crisis. Sustainable mobility projects materialise and spatialise, in various ways, democratic values within public space. The article therefore studies the strategies employed to mark the urban territory with green mobility infrastructures (part 1); it reveals the construction of a discursive space that polarises local debates (part 2); it describes the symbolic reintegration of Valencia into a network of model cities (part 3). Such a strategy does not create an effective Mediterranean model of the cycle-friendly city, because it does not modify the structural organisation of space or the social representations that underpin current mobility practices (part 4). © 2020 Societe Belge de Geographie.

T2  - International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology
AB  - United Nations propounded the key to sustainable development, including the Environmental health and social well-being of society. In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents’ social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches. The aim of this study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic and investigate the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City. The study employed by executed the survey to the communities in Karkh district. Respondents (n=306) were selected in a single-random procedure to assess population attitudes towards a pocket park for social and physical activities. The results confirmed that a lack of outdoor daily social interaction in Baghdad City due to the inefficient nearby pocket parks. Thus, there is a need for efficient pocket parks designed to be provided. In this study, the characteristics of efficient pocket park design identified as providing suitable activities and elements, accessibility, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance in the pocket park design. This study contributes to the definitions of pocket parks and nearby open spaces by investigating these spaces' characteristics and benefits towards the social well-being of communities, in achieving the goal of a sustainable community in sustainable city development. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.

TI  - Grassroots urbanism in contemporary São Paulo
AU  - Sandler, D.
T2  - Urban Design International
AB  - In the last decade, manifestations of grassroots urbanism have transformed São Paulo into a playfield for creative interventions. Initiatives focus on art, culture, and education; greenery and open spaces; public equipment; water and environmental resources; and gender, race, and class justice. I argue that these initiatives are more than the sum of their parts; they influence social imaginaries, expectations, and urban policies beyond the scope of each case. My research tries to understand crucial differences among initiatives—while some open up spaces for the emancipation of disenfranchised groups, others inadvertently engage in processes of gentrification and exclusion despite claims to representing a diverse public. These differences in goals and outcomes can be understood in terms of the opposition between tactical and insurgent urbanism. As such, the study of these differences is meaningful not only for understanding the case of São Paulo, but also for expanding theoretical debates on grassroots urbanism at a global scale. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Patch, matrix and human-induced disturbance variables are important in determining the structure of urban bird communities. Although green spaces in urban core areas are usually small and disturbed, they can be important for local bird diversity. Because such areas are often overlooked, their study is critical for successfully incorporating biodiversity conservation in urban planning. Furthermore, comparing bird communities from different biogeographical areas would help identify generalizable patterns and propose common management actions. We compared the structure of breeding season bird assemblages of managed small public green spaces in the urban core areas of two similar-sized European cities, Kavala (Greece) and Rovaniemi (Finland), and studied the influence of environmental variables on community structure. Species composition differed between the cities. Abundance and evenness were higher in Kavala, while richness and diversity did not differ between the cities. Abundance did not respond in a general way to the same variables in the two cities. It increased with decreasing shrub cover and distance from the city center and with increasing midday noise and ground cover in Kavala, but increased with increasing distance from the city center and decreased with increasing car traffic and midday noise in Rovaniemi. This might be explained by the lower abundance of bird dwellers in Rovaniemi. Primarily gray cover, but also other variables, at both the patch and matrix levels (e.g., noise, car traffic, distance from the city center), negatively affected richness, evenness and diversity in both cities. Green space size was positively correlated with richness and diversity in Kavala, but not in Rovaniemi, possibly due to the smaller size variation in Rovaniemi. Results emphasized that increasing gray cover is harmful for birds in small-sized green spaces in urban core areas. However, urban managers should note that not all bird community metrics responded in similar ways to same environmental variables. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Journal of Cleaner Production
AB  - This paper aims to assess the effects of urbanization on heat stress comparing two neighbourhoods in the tropical city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that differ in terms of building density and vegetation cover. The outdoor heat stress was evaluated by the Wet Bulb-Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index, which considers the combined effect of air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed, during the year of 2016. The urban neighbourhood presented statistically (p < 0.01) higher WBGT levels (mean value 23.48 °C), than the suburban neighbourhood (mean value 22.0 °C). The results highlighted the effect of low wind velocities on heat stress in the urban environment over 75% of the time. Building spacing and street orientation considering the most frequent wind directions must be taken into account during the urban planning process. Otherwise stagnant air conditions in urban environments become a common feature that cannot be reverted. Under such circumstances, green areas such as pocket parks, green roofs and green walls should be implemented to mitigate heat stress. Public policies for many neighbourhoods in Brazilian cities are necessary to increase vegetated areas aiming to improve conditions of well-being. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Urban Policy and Research
AB  - “Temporary” and “tactical” (T/T) urbanism is argued to herald a more agile future for urban design and planning, enhancing urban intensity, community engagement, innovation, resilience and local identity. Drawing on interviews with expert practitioners, this paper explores the distinctive character of Australian “T/T” urbanism approaches. It examines their diverse, dynamic assemblages of actors and interests, and their links to neoliberal deregulation, austerity, gentrification, and to long-term state planning and investment. While Australian T/T urbanism follows overseas precedents, it is seen less as a“DIY” or “guerrilla” response to neoliberal regimes, and more focussed on enhancing citizen engagement and collaboration within planning. © 2021 Editorial Board, Urban Policy and Research.

T2  - Arquiteturarevista
AB  - Urban protests in the twentieth century marked a social and political change that altered the way we transform our cities, or at least should have, so that we design urban spaces for people, but mostly with people. Today, it seems clear that participation and bottom-up processes are central to the urban project. In this context, our current research focuses on creating a methodology with new strategies (information and communication technologies, fun tools such as urban sketching and tactical planning). In this research, we analyse recent case studies, in which the final recipients of urban planning, its users, co-design the project. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the method we use in TEA / OSW (Taller Espacios Abiertos / Open spaces Workshop). This method follows the idea of urban action or urban DIY and has been studied at two levels: first, as a mechanism of participation and second as a new way of teaching architecture, with urban actions at a scale of 1:1. This case study examines the transformation of the old railway station into a cultural centre, which took place through co-creation workshops, assemblies, evolutive models and, above all, self-build workshops. To obtain the results, we used quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The results show that the workshop was successful not only as a participative tool, but also as a social process and a way of learning in design and architecture. © 2020, Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

AU  - Herman, K.

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - The COVID‐19 pandemic generated a number of changes in the functioning of urban areas all over the world and had a visible impact on the use of green infrastructure, including city parks. The study discusses and compares operation and use of two such parks located in Wellington, New Zealand and Warsaw, Poland by adopting ʺpandemic urban ethnographyʺ, an approach that in-cludes autoethnography, interviews with users, non‐participant observation, and analysis of social media content. As indicated by the findings of the study, the importance of less rigidly designed, multifunctional spaces that give their users freedom of ʺtacticalʺ adjustments, significantly grows during times of lockdown and ʺsocial distancingʺ. During such a crisis, the management and every-day use of urban parks are highly related to urban policies. The article provides insight into how those policies impact the functional values of green infrastructure confronting it with user‐gener-ated adaptations and the landscape design itself. The global health emergency showed how access to green areas becomes a crucial determinant on environmental justice while proving the significance of ʺtactical pandemic urbanismʺ as both a design and management method. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The availability of parks and urban green spaces has been associated with a number of benefits, including increased physical activity, improvements in mental health, increases in social interactions, improvements to the environment, and increases in property values. The installation of temporary pop-up parks in urban areas is one way for urban communities to obtain these benefits. In this mixed-methods study, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered by researchers, the city council, a local investment company, and community residents that informed the initiation, iteration, and incremental expansion of a series of temporary, summer pop-up parks in the downtown business district of the City of Los Altos in Northern California over a 4-year period (2013–2016). Results showed that the parks were visited by a large, multigenerational group of users who engaged in leisure-time physical activity, shopped at local stores, attended programed events, and socialized with others. Direct observation and survey data gathered in year 2014 also indicated that foot traffic into businesses directly fronting on a pop-up park (n = 8) was higher during a 4-day period when the park was in place, as compared to a similar 4-day period before the park was installed. The majority of downtown business owners/managers reported no decrease in sales compared to the month before the pop-up park was installed. City sales tax data indicated increases in year-on-year sales tax revenue in the summer quarter of 2014 and 2016 compared with the year (2015) when there was no downtown pop-up park. Perspectives of community residents collected before, during, and after the installation of the pop-up parks indicated that the pop-up park created a vibrant space in an otherwise underutilized area that was enjoyed by a variety of people in a host of ways (e.g., children playing, families relaxing, people shopping and eating at downtown stores and restaurants, people of all ages attending scheduled park events). These results informed a number of discussions and meetings between key stakeholders about the pop-up parks, culminating in a temporary park that was held in a new location in 2017 that was substantially larger in size, installed for a longer time period, cost more, and had more scheduled park events. Results from this prospective investigation of the initial impacts of pop-up parks in this urban location provide insights regarding the potential benefits and viability of such temporary parks for residents and businesses alike. © 2020, The New York Academy of Medicine.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - Urban parks are important within cities and towns for mitigating high air temperatures and improving human thermal comfort, especially during hot summer conditions. We demonstrate this benefit through an analysis of the climatic interactions between a relatively small (1.5 Ha), inner-city park and its surrounding urban environment in Melbourne, Australia, during the hot Austral summer of 2013−14. On average, the park was cooler than its surrounding built-up area at all times and in all weather conditions. The park's mean maximum cooling reached 1.0 °C during peak daytime heating (15:00), with the magnitude of difference between the park and its surroundings varying from 0.5−3 °C. During the day, the magnitude of park cooling was greater in sunny conditions and under higher wind speeds in the park (relative to the surrounding streets). However at night, park cooling was less variable and dominantly influenced by the characteristics of the site such as Sky View Factor (SVF), vegetation distribution and irrigation. The results showed a downwind propagation of the cooling effect of the park that extended up to one half a park width away from the park. Tree shading and evapotranspiration in the park could reduce the level of heat stress from strong in the nearby streets, to comfortable within the park. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Forest patch size predicts seed bank composition in urban areas
AU  - Doroski, D.A.
AU  - Duguid, M.C.

T2  - Applied Vegetation Science
AB  - Questions: As urban areas expand around the world, understanding how to restore and maintain forests within the urban environment becomes increasingly important. Given that a comprehensive understanding of regeneration dynamics is critical to designating appropriate management interventions we ask the following: how does regeneration, vis-à-vis the buried seed bank, vary in heterogenous urban forests? And, can forest patch size be used to predict regeneration and consequent management interventions?. Location: Vacant lots and public parks throughout New Haven, CT, USA. Methods: We sampled buried seed banks in 131 plots distributed across three forest patch sizes ranging from large intact parks (95–126 ha), to small parks (1–19 ha), and vacant lots (0.05–0.65 ha). We collected soil samples from the surface mineral soil and stratified them over sand in a greenhouse over a period of five months to record germination. Results: By examining seed bank floristics in a range of forest patch sizes we found that species composition, nativity, and dominance of specific functional groups shifted with patch size representing a spectrum of urbanization within just one city. Seed bank floristics in large parks more closely resembled results from seed bank studies in rural forests with over 85% native germinants on average. In contrast, vacant lots were dominated by non-native germinants and more ruderal species indicative of earlier successional stages. Seed banks in small parks were variable and in some cases were more similar to large parks or vacant lots. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that large parks in urban areas may be largely self-sustaining whereas smaller parks may require more intensive management for site rehabilitation, especially in early states of succession. Furthermore, our results confirm the highly heterogenous nature of urban forest patches and call for more systematic sampling of urban areas to capture this variation and improve management prescriptions and outcomes. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science

T2  - Fragmenta Entomologica
AB  - The exotic ant Monomorium carbonarium (Smith, 1858) is recorded for two new cities in the Iberian Peninsula. A hundred workers of this black little ant were recovered from a pitfall trap in a small urban park in the city of Alacant (SE Iberia). A visual inspection revealed a large colony with numerous nest entrances, but confined in space. Its absence in other colliding parks and green areas of the city suggests an early stage of invasion. It is also first detected in three parks in the city of Barcelona (NE Iberia). Two queen phenotypes are imaged, winged and ergatoid, the second one previously unknown. The invasive potential of the species is discussed. © 2021. All rights reserved

T2  - Journal of Planning Literature
AB  - Traditional urban planning projects require considerable time, political buy-in, and capital. Conversely, small-scale urban interventions can be executed quickly and inexpensively. However, the terms used to describe these projects—such as tactical, pop-up, temporary, or insurgent urbanism—are numerous and overlapping, making them hard to distinguish from each other. We suggest that a single unifying term, punctual urbanism, can capture these different urbanisms. To justify this choice, we provide definitions and examples, as well as an overarching framework for understanding these urbanisms on the basis of two dimensions: who is implementing them and what is their temporal scale. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This paper presents a framework to support the assessment of urban design projects through Urban Living Labs (ULLs). The framework is based on the Tactical Urbanism (TU) practices and involves the use of Mobile Urban Elements (MUE) in uncertain and potentially confusing conditions (e.g., the COVID‐19 context). The methodology includes the application of the Four‐Phase Model (problem and ideation; development; implementation, testing and assessment; final pro-posal) and a quantitative and qualitative assessment. The proposed assessment criteria were developed through an evaluation according to three aspects: (1) feasibility impact; (2) social impact; and (3) spatial impact. The methodology was applied to Furnish, an urban design project based on a ULL and prototyping, which was recently developed in five European cities. The empirical results, obtained using the impact analysis, indicate that the prototypes developed in the project are trans-ferable to other cities and generate social interaction in public spaces. The applied research showed that the Four‐Phase Model may be used as a new and improved iterative design process: the LOOP Scheme. The application of this assessment methodology to ULLs may provide valuable information for the future planning of urban interventions in public spaces. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - “Letting in the Light”: Jacob Riis’s Crusade for Breathing Spaces on the Lower East Side
AU  - deNoyelles, A.
T2  - Journal of Urban History
AB  - During the twentieth century, Jacob Riis’s once-widely-acknowledged role as father of the urban small-parks movement receded in historical significance in favor of his contributions to journalism, photography, housing reform, and settlement work. This pattern overlooks the central importance that Riis himself placed on parks and playgrounds activism in his broader social agenda, at one point calling it “the logical sequel to ‘How the Other Half Lives.’” This essay examines how Riis, through his efforts to provide New York’s tenement districts with “breathing spaces,” refashioned eminent domain from a rhetorical concept into a potent tool for reformers to assert control over working-class urban spaces. It also considers the impact of these projects on the working-class denizens of Riis’s proposed park sites, who viewed their homes in a markedly different light. © The Author(s) 2019.

TI  - Form follows comfort: An evidence-based approach to enhancing streetscapes
AU  - Zwangsleitner, F.
T2  - Journal of Digital Landscape Architecture
AB  - In densely growing cities, an increasing competition for public open spaces can be observed. Streetscapes often present themselves as a hotchpotch of objects related to both moving and stationary traffic. Consequently, in some areas it has become difficult to move freely as a pedestrian or cyclist, and safety issues often arise. In addition, the general public is deprived of potential open spaces with high amenity quality. Furthermore, the remaining spaces are frequently occupied by cafes and restaurants, which forces people to consume and spend money in order to use them. While these locations certainly contribute to the vibrancy of a city, qualitative public spaces to dwell in without having to consume are becoming rare. This situation is contrary to the understanding that public open spaces should be democratic places that can be used by everyone. This paper presents an approach that aims to help redefine the priorities of public open space usage by enhancing the quality of streetscapes. In the context of climate change and its increasing impact on urban open spaces, climate is an increasingly important parameter for this. Thus, the paper will illustrate which design information can be derived from climatic impacts for small-scaled streetscape interventions, such as parklets and pocket parks, through a parametric analysis approach. The approach is tested through a case study analysis in Berlin. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH.

AB  - Large parks have been studied for their tranquil and restorative properties, including in the sonic dimension. The auditory experience of users in small urban public spaces, such as pocket parks is less well understood, especially as they can contain sound sources much more reflective of dense, urban activities. Musikiosk, a soundscape intervention, was deployed in a small Montreal park that allowed users to bring their own devices and play their own content over publicly provided speakers. A questionnaire study (N = 197) revealed that users found the park more pleasant, eventful, and vibrant with the presence of Musikiosk, without an associated change in calmness or appropriateness, and better for their mood states than a typical park visit. Musikiosk also reduced the likelihood that park users mentioned hearing traffic noise. Those who were more noise sensitive experienced most of the benefits of both the park visit and Musikiosk, however it did not diminish their mentions of traffic noise. These results have implications for theories and policies concerning the sounds of public spaces. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapidly growing cities often struggle with insufficient green space, although information on when and where more green space is needed can be difficult to collect. Big data on the density of individuals in cities collected from mobile phones can estimate the usage intensity of urban green space. Taking Zhengzhou's central city as an example, we combine the real-time human movement data provided by the Baidu Heat Map, which indicates the density of mobile phones, with vector overlays of different kinds of green space. We used the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to estimate differentials in green space usage between weekdays and weekends, utilizing the location and the density of the aggregation of people with powered-up mobile phones. Compared with weekends, the aggregation of people in urban green spaces on workdays tends to vary more in time and be more concentrated in space, while the highest usage is more stable on weekends. More importantly, the percentage of weekday green space utilization is higher in small parks and green strips in the city, with the density increasing in those small areas, while the green space at a greater distance to the city center is underutilized. This study validates the potential of applying Baidu Heat Map data to provide a dynamic perspective of green space use, and highlights the need for more green space in city centers. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - “Putting the cult in cultivate”: a rhetoric of guerrilla gardening in Green Valentine
AU  - Pâquet, L.
T2  - Green Letters
AB  - Green Valentine: (2015), by Australian author Lili Wilkinson, is a young adult romance in which two teenagers rebel against their local council by guerrilla gardening. By taking part in an illegal activity, the protagonists of Green Valentine stage a political protest that stands in for their voices, which are silenced in public debates about the environmental future that they will inherit. Throughout this article, I examine the rhetoric of guerrilla gardening represented in Green Valentine. While the protagonists are too young to vote, their gardening is an active argument that communicates their political hopes. I conclude that the rhetoric of gardening in Green Valentine underscores the importance of community and political action to stop the capitalist production of spaces that impair the environmental future. © 2020 ASLE-UKI.

AB  - Urban street networks in the United States have been primarily designed for automobile traffic with negligible considerations to non-motorized transportation users. Due to environmental issues and quality of life concerns, communities are reclaiming street spaces for active modes and slowing the speeds in their downtown. Moreover, tactical urbanism, i.e., the use of street space for innovative purposes other than moving automobile traffic, is becoming attractive due to reduced automobile travel demand and the need for outdoor activities in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides details of the modeling of an urban downtown network (in the City of San Jose) using microscopic traffic simulation. The model is then applied to evaluate the effectiveness of street design changes at varying demand scenarios. The microsimulation approach was chosen because it allows for the detailed modeling and visualization of the transportation networks, including movements of individual vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The street design change demonstrated here involves one-way to two-way street conversion, but the framework of network-wide impact evaluation may also be used for complete street conversions. The base conditions network was also tested under different travel demand reduction scenarios (10%, 20%, and 30%) to identify the corridors in the city network in which the tactical urbanism strategies (e.g., open-air dining) may be best accommodated. The study provides framework for the use of a microscopic model as part of a decision support system to evaluate and effectively implement complete streets/tactical urbanism strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

AU  - Thiel, F.

T2  - DISP
AB  - Frankfurt am Main is well-known for its financial centre of Europe and recognised as the German city with the highest concentration of high-rise buildings (“skyline”). For several years now, this construction class has also been discovered for hotel, residential and hybrid usages. After the events of 9/11, high-rise construction came to a standstill worldwide. Which domestic and international developer would want to build the highest high-rise as an investment landmark in a city? Instead, smaller residential towers at a height of 60–80 m were preferred by investors. Twenty years later, the completion of an initial 15 hybrid-use high-rise towers in the city of Frankfurt am Main is expected by the year 2023. Other German cities such as Berlin, Hamburg and Dusseldorf are following similar strategies to implement vertical allocations of property rights in towers embedded in selected privately owned (semi-)public spaces. The amenities include arcades, pocket parks, seating areas, landscape terraces, rooftop bars and swimming pools. We will discuss the renaissance of high-rises, which is a market-based and marketing-based approach following the monetary policy of the European Central Bank, wooing investors at a time of unprecedented speed of construction of tall, particularly hybrid, buildings. In the case study of the ‘Four’ inner-city revitalisation project, located on plots formerly known as ‘ the forbidden town’ of Frankfurt as this area was blocked to the public for decades, we will pay particular attention to the planning department’s right to regulate. The findings presented here are the result of scientific project work conducted in 2019–2020. The local government has imposed a 30% mandatory quota for affordable, subsidised housing rents and price reduced condominiums as legally binding requirements for tower constructions to prevent vertical gated communities. Our essay deals with the central areas of real estate development: land and capital investment. © 2021 ETH–Eidenössiche Technische Hochschule Zürich.

AB  - There is in general good awareness of the potential role of green roofs to regulate urban thermal environments, but a lack of effective spatial modeling of this cooling effect for a given roof greening scheme at the city scale. This study proposes a simplified and feasible approach to simulate the cooling effect provided by green roofs as a mitigation option to combat urban heat island effects in high-density urban areas. In this study, we established a spatial model of the cooling effect of green roofs, which integrated remote sensing methods and a statistical model based on the law of diminishing marginal utility of the cooling efficiency of green roofs (DMUCE) deduced from previous studies. A case study in Xiamen City, China demonstrates the applicability and implications of the model. Our modeling clearly simulated the size and strength of the urban cool island and its variation under different green roof scenarios. We found that green roofs play an important part in moderating the thermal environment in areas where larger green spaces and waterbodies are largely absent. When the proportion of green roofs is implemented at scale, roofs that are only partly green can also create some extra cool islands (not merely normal islands) in high-density urban areas, equivalent to small green spaces and waterbodies. The sensitivity analysis of the cooling effect indicated that the maximum potential benefit of heat island reduction ranged from 4.04 km2 to 9.75 km2 when the coverage of green roofs was extended to the entire Xiamen Island. Besides, our results suggested that all proposed strategies would not remarkably moderate the thermal environment in the north of Xiamen Island, where urban planners should pay more attention in the future. © 2021

AB  - In densely populated cities with high-rise buildings, large green spaces are a limited resource, and it is hard to visit large green spaces frequently due to long distance from places of residence. Small Urban Green Space (SUGS) in dense city areas might contribute to satisfy the need for everyday experiences of outdoor areas, but the study on SUGS use is limited, in particular in Asian contexts.The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of socio-demographic factors, personal factors, spatial attributes of residence, and satisfaction with park features on the use of SUGS and sources of motivation for visiting SUGS. Data were collected through face-to-face survey, and were analyzed using a hierarchical regression model. Results showed that relaxation and rest (36 %), physical exercise (23 %), and meeting friends (21 %) were the three most widespread reasons for SUGS use. The results indicated that socio-demographic factors, personal factors, spatial attributes of residence and park features factors explained 23 %, 2%, 25.6 % and 3% of the total variance in frequency of park visitation, respectively. Age, being willing to spend time in nature, with child under 7 years, noise and facility were positively correlated with SUGS use. Income,distance from home to the park, and residential green spaces were negatively correlated with SUGS use.Our findings are expected to assist urban planners in creating guidelines to better utilize SUGS. © 2021

AB  - As municipalities across the global North highlight urban agriculture as a marker of their ‘greenness’, how can we best understand how the spaces and practices of urban food production are governed? This article develops an analysis of urban agriculture as a complex site of governance in which numerous interests engage. We underscore the politics of governance, through which some actors resist the imposition of a narrowly normative and exclusive notion of urban agriculture and against which they envision and enact alternatives. The article contributes to efforts to transcend the often dichotomous framing of urban agriculture as radical or neoliberal, formal or informal, political or post-political by employing ‘everyday governance’ and ‘everyday resistance’ as lenses through which to focus on the prosaic practices of engaging with, pushing back against, and stepping beyond the imposition of hegemonic models of urban agriculture. We argue that the co-constitutive, ‘braided’ nature of urban agricultural governance is revealed through attention to the manifold forms of negotiation and resistance to formal urban agricultural governance. Moreover, our perspective highlights the ways that some practitioners are excluded by, challenge, or re-vision formal definitions of urban agriculture. We draw on the cases of Portland, OR and Vancouver, BC to illustrate our argument. © 2021 Urban Research Publications Limited

AB  - In the context of global warming, more and more cities are experiencing extreme Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects and extreme weather phenomena, but urban green spaces are proven to mitigate UHI. Most of UHI's research focuses on the large scale and uses remote sensing methods, which do not reflect the dynamic characteristics in detail and do not detect internal influencing factors of the green space cooling effect. Therefore, this study focused on Small Green Spaces (SGS), carrying out the measurement of the meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, wind speed, photosynthetic radiation) of the 16 sites in four types of coverage (Impervious surface; Shrub-grass; Tree-grass; Tree-shrub-grass) in a university campus. At the same time, the coverage characteristic parameters, such as Canopy Density (CD), Leaf Area Index (LAI), Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), Mean Leaf Angle (MLA), of each plot were analyzed and compared. The results showed that there were significant differences in temperature among different coverage types in SGS. The biggest difference was concentrated in the noon period when solar radiation is strongest during the day. The difference between the four types of coverage with vegetation at night was small. The maximum air temperature difference among the four types could reach 8.9 °C and the maximum relative humidity difference was 28.5%. The cooling effect of the multi-layer vegetation-covered (Tree-shrub-grass) area was the largest compared to the impervious surface, indicating that tree cover was the core factor affecting the temperature. Temperature and relative humidity had a close correlation with surface coverage types and some plant community characteristics (such as CD and LAI). The cooling and humidifying effects of plants were also related to PAR and leaf angle. The results provide suggestions for green space management and landscape design. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Urban Green Spaces (UGS) provide various environmental benefits to nature and are essential for people's overall well-being. UGS regulate temperature and humidity, absorb pollutants, and reduce soil erosion. Also, they improve the emotional and physical well-being of people and increase the environmental awareness of citizens. Due to its great importance, various studies have sought to economically quantify its value through the housing market. However, the households' heterogeneity and the vegetation index of the UGS have not been analyzed together. In this study, we show that a developing country's population values the UGS (economically). Still, that valuation depends on the housing submarket and the interaction between “distance” and vegetation index. For example, for small parks, the interaction between “distance” and vegetation index is significant only in the highest and lowest conditional quantiles. For medium and large parks, the interaction is significant only from the 50th and 30th percentiles, respectively. On the other hand, for small, medium, and large forests, the interactive variable is significant starting from the 50th, 70th, and 80th percentiles, respectively. We, also make recommendations for public policy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Landscape Research
AB  - Do-It-Yourself urbanism has often been attributed with the capacity to revitalise urban environments in the absence of formal planning activity. However, there is still limited understanding of the ways in which such practices emerge and establish agency within their respective environments. We bring a relational lens to the debate, presenting a framework for identifying how the socio-spatial conditions within the urban landscape enable and constrain citizen-led spatial appropriation. Using a visually oriented, multi-modal approach, the framework is applied to five sites in Glasgow, Scotland, which we conceptualise as Edgelands in a post-industrial city. Findings reveal that informal citizen practices adaptively come into being through a process of negotiation with their social and material context. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for fostering citizen agency in revitalising the post-industrial city and other urban settings that include wastescapes. © 2020 The Author(s).

AU  - Herman, K.

T2  - Land
AB  - A singular and modest activist action, a temporary park created in San Francisco, grew into the global urban Park(ing) Day (PD) phenomenon. This tactical urbanism event not only expanded to be annually celebrated in thousands of parking lots all over the world but became an inspiration for urban planning and policy changes. The permanent rendition of Park(ing) Day, parklets, resulted from the movement but did not stop the spread of PD itself. This article presents case studies from New Zealand and Poland, two geographically and culturally distant locations where PD has further developed and evolved gaining local qualities. Through research methods such as research in design, secondary data analysis and expert interviews we study the trajectory of PD evolution and the role and interpretation of it in different parts of the globe. The results show a narrative of successive popularisation and institutionalisation as well as diversification. Departing from its grassroots, guerilla and assertive traits, PD has grown to become an artistic, creative and urban planning tool. As an established, recognised action and an 'attractive' idea, PD has great potential for designer education, allowing a venue for implementing methods such as design-build and live project. © 2020 by the authors.

AU  - Sara, R.

T2  - CoDesign
AB  - Austerity has led to a growing interest in small-scale urban practices that engage community groups in participatory placemaking as an alternative to developing government or commercially funded parks and urban spaces. These approaches draw on bottom-up tactics to empower local community groups to take ownership of small communal spaces but are also often supported strategically by small financial grants provided by local and national governments. In this article, we draw on de Certeau’s theory of strategies and tactics to explore the relationship between top-down strategies and bottom-up tactics in urban placemaking in response to the politics of austerity. We explore this process through critical analysis of our own participatory action research project to engage in the ideation and implementation of a community-run ‘Pocket-Park’. We argue that the complex interplay between participatory bottom-up tactics and more formal top-down strategies provides an approach to placemaking that uniquely facilitates creative practice and allows for a resurgence in non-commercialised public placemaking. We identify a process of manoeuvres (or strategic tactics) between de Certeau’s two concepts in which key participants undertake a translational process, to unlock the resources needed to support tactical placemaking. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Urban green space arrangement for an optimal landscape planning strategy for runoff reduction
AU  - Yang, B.
AU  - Lee, D.
T2  - Land
AB  - Increased impervious surfaces due to urbanization have reduced evaporation and infiltration into the soil compared with existing natural water cycle systems, which causes various problems, such as urban floods, landslides, and deterioration of water quality. To effectively solve the urban water cycle issue, green infrastructure using urban green space has emerged to reduce runoff and increase evaporation. It has the advantage of restoring the water cycle system of urban areas by complementing the failure of conventional stormwater treatment systems. However, urban areas under high-density development have limited green space for stormwater treatment. Hence, it is necessary to efficiently utilize street trees and small green spaces to improve the urban water cycle through green space. In this study, we simulated different green space distribution scenarios in the virtual domain to find the optimal strategy of green space planning. Compared to clustered scenarios, dispersed green space distribution scenarios and placing green space downstream were more effective in reducing the runoff amount. The paper provides insights into the considerations for determining green space spatial plan and zoning regulations for stormwater treatment by green infrastructure. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - A growing number of studies have mapped the demand for ecosystem services (ES). Recently, demand for ES has been broadened to include cultural services in addition to ecological services, especially for urbanized areas. In this study, a multi-criteria approach is proposed that synthesizes the available ecological and cultural services to map the demand for ES: including 1) soil erosion sensitivity, 2) geological hazard sensitivity, 3) water management, 4) vegetation coverage, 5) permanent farmland, 6) accessibility, 7) population density, 8) direct use of green spaces, and 9) cultural heritage. The cultural services demand describes the desire or preference, and consumption or direct use of cultural services, e.g. recreation and cultural heritage. Most studies discussed only the desire or preference for cultural services because of the difficulty quantifying the actual consumption of these cultural services. This research gap was filled using the check-in data collected from WeChat (a major social network in China). Each criterion was assigned a weight so that the ecological services demand, the cultural services demand, and the overall ES demand could be quantified. The results suggest that in general, the mountainous areas, farmlands, and suburban areas have high demand for ecological services while public parks in urban areas show high demand for cultural services. However, the ES demand in the availability of some small green spaces in highly urbanized areas may be higher than that for large green spaces in suburban areas. This multi-criteria analysis is necessary to obtain a comprehensive assessment of ES demand, which will contribute to improving the applicability of ES in real-world decision making, e.g. green space planning and conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Tactical urbanism: Colour interventions with purpose
AU  - O'Connor, Z.
T2  - Color Research and Application
AB  - Evidence-based colour interventions in the urban landscape are becoming more common in many countries and some have garnered the term “tactical urbanism”, defined as relatively low-cost changes to the built environment intended to provide a quick solution to an urban environment challenge. This article reports on two proposed small-scale colour interventions that aim to calm traffic, prioritize pedestrian traffic, support safety initiatives, and enhance the urban environment. Inspired by both larger and small interventions around the world, the rationale for two proposed colour interventions in Sydney is described along with the findings of a two-stage survey conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed colour intervention designs. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Within the BlueHealth project, funded under the Horizon 2020 European Union research framework, a number of targeted experimental design interventions were used to test the effect and impact of planning and design on encouraging people to use various blue spaces. Complex interventions were implemented and evaluations before and after each were made using a set of tools which triangulate with each other-a site assessment tool, a behaviour observation tool, a questionnaire survey (including an economic evaluation) and qualitative interviews. The theoretical basis for the research is that of affordances, and the projects each involved modest changes to the landscape using the approach of "urban acupuncture" where a small intervention can potentially have an effect out of all proportion to the investment. This paper is a protocol paper and describes the research strategy and methodology in detail for one of the intervention sites, located in Plymouth in the UK. The aim is to present the methodology as a whole so as to act as (a) a reference framework for the results of all the projects which will be reported separately in a series of research articles once all the results are in and analysed and (b) a useful reference for other researchers wishing to carry out such complex projects and where a comprehensive presentation of the strategy and methodology is unavailable. We offer this protocol for reference, for critique and for inspiration to those following us. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The method presented in the article is helpful for analyzing the aesthetical landscape preferences. Using visual and physical plant combinations in small abandoned spaces, this study seeks to discover what citizens prefer in terms of coherence, legibility, and refuge? The procedure relies on visual questioning to get residents’ opinion based on three criteria: legibility, coherence, and refuge. Specifically, it aims at exploring the relation of three landscape variables with the enclosure. Participants gave the lowest ratings for refuge in visually open & physically open environments, according to the data. In visually open environments, the participants' perception of coherence does not vary significantly. When compared to other characteristics (coherence and legibility), the research of spatial configurations of vest-pocket parks shows that enclosure is more important in terms of refuge. Finally, the significant difference between object-focused parks and others indicated the critical design process of this type of pocket park. • Visual questionnaire survey is helpful for analyzing the aesthetical landscape preferences. • A photomontage method could apply design possibilities in relation to planting. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Perceptions of park visitors on access to urban parks and benefits of green spaces
AU  - Basu, S.
AU  - Nagendra, H.
T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - There has been limited research on understanding access to public green spaces in cities of the global South. In a study in Hyderabad, India, we interview visitors in four parks to understand their perceptions of and access to ecosystem services. Of these, two parks charge entry fees and two provide free entry or entry at minimal cost. Most users value the park as a recreational space, but are largely unable to access provisioning services such as food and fodder. This poses a particular challenge for low income residents. In the large parks with high vegetation cover, visitors could identify a variety of trees, plants, and birds, while in the smallest neighbourhood park which has the least amount of greenery, they could only identify a small number of species. Parks were visited more by men than by women, who cited challenges of lack of time, and lack of safety. Park entry fees also acted as barriers, for low income groups. The two parks located in wealthy and gentrifying neighbourhoods were almost exclusively accessed by middle class and wealthy visitors, because of the entry fee. Surveys of willingness to pay found that wealthy visitors were keen to pay an entry fee and did not seem to understand the implications of such a fee on exclusion, low income visitors expressed negative views. A central role of the urban park as a ‘public space’ within a city is to nourish the sense of community. Yet some parks have been converted into landscaped and designed areas with high public investment, and entry charges, with limited provision for harvesting ecosystem services. Thus even in public spaces like parks, we observe stark gender and income inequalities, leading to the uneven access to green space. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Listening to Japanese gardens: An autoethnographic study on the soundscape action design tool
AU  - Cerwén, G.
T2  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
AB  - Landscape architecture and urban design disciplines could benefit from soundscape thinking in order to enhance experiential qualities in their projects, though the available tools are not yet fully developed nor tested. The present research aims to substantiate one of the available tools, Soundscape Actions, and thereby increase the understanding of soundscape design. The study focuses on the Japanese garden tradition, which is known for high preference ratings, tranquil qualities and consideration for sound and other sensory experiences. An autoethnographic approach was used to conduct field studies in 88 gardens in Japan, the majority of which are located in urban areas with potential noise disturbance. The studies are based on observations in situ, supported by video documentation, field recordings and readings of sound pressure levels (SPL). A total of 19 Soundscape Actions are described and discussed in the paper. They are structured around three main categories: localisation of functions, reduction of unwanted sounds and introduction of wanted sounds. The study provides concrete examples of how the tool can be used to enhance tranquil qualities, particularly focusing on small green spaces in dense urban settings, involving the (simultaneous) reduction of unwanted sounds and enhancement of wanted sounds/effects. The autoethnographic approach allowed for the phenomenological perspective to be brought forward, which contributed new insights regarding the design tool. The findings are discussed in relation to health and soundscape research, focusing on multisensory experiences, masking strategies and potentials for implementation and future developments of the design tool. © 2019 by the author.

TI  - Rethinking the Right to the City: DIY Urbanism and Postcapitalist Possibilities
AU  - Foster, N.
T2  - Rethinking Marxism
AB  - Lefebvre’s “right to the city” concept is often used to describe how individuals are challenging late capitalism and neoliberal development by appropriating urban space for collective use. While some argue that DIY urbanism can be framed as a right to the city, others dismiss its political potential. However, dominant interpretations of right to the city do not engage with Lefebvre’s interest in the body and affect, themes that resonate with both Gibson-Graham’s politics of becoming as well as DIY urbanism. By identifying these linkages, this essay constructs an alternative, vital reading of Lefebvre’s right to the city in order to explore the radical potential of DIY urbanism. It grounds this theoretical framework in an ethnographic case study of DIY projects enacted between 2012 and 2016 in Fort Worth, Texas. The essay then discusses the importance of highlighting the micropolitics of everyday urban life in order to identify and nurture their postcapitalist possibilities. © 2020 Association for Economic and Social Analysis.

TI  - Green gentrification or ‘just green enough’: Do park location, size and function affect whether a place gentrifies or not?
AU  - Rigolon, A.
AU  - Németh, J.
T2  - Urban Studies
AB  - Recent research shows that the establishment of new parks in historically disinvested neighbourhoods can result in housing price increases and the displacement of low-income people of colour. Some suggest that a ‘just green enough’ approach, in particular its call for the creation of small parks and nearby affordable housing, can reduce the chances of this phenomenon some call ‘green gentrification’. Yet, no study has tested these claims empirically across a sample of diverse cities. Focusing on 10 cities in the United States, we run multilevel logistic regressions to uncover whether the location (distance from downtown), size and function (active transportation) of new parks built in the 2000–2008 and 2008–2015 periods predict whether the census tracts around them gentrified. We find that park function and location are strong predictors of gentrification, whereas park size is not. In particular, new greenway parks with an active transportation component built in the 2008–2015 period triggered gentrification more than other park types, and new parks located closer to downtown tend to foster gentrification more than parks on a city’s outskirts. These findings call into question the ‘just green enough’ claim that small parks foster green gentrification less than larger parks do. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.

T2  - Journal of Urbanism
AB  - This paper explores the dynamics between social innovations and socio-spatial transformations using practice theory as linking pin. Social innovations, such as the case study of a meal sharing platform here presented, are considered as proposals. Using social practice theory as a theoretical lens enables us to explain how the principles of the proposal’s design are moderated and appropriated by its users. Consequently, familiar routinized practices expand, becoming more complex and hybrid. It is in the performance of the practice that this complexity is revealed. Specific focus is on the socio-spatial transformations that social innovations propose. This paper shows how tactics of appropriation can result in trespassing the boundaries between private and public, and between domestic and communitarian space. This way, we connect social innovations to DIY-urbanism, showing how citizens appropriate urban space. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

T2  - Journal of Planning History
AB  - In the 1930s and 1940s, multiple five-year Soviet plans for national industrialization transformed Ukraine’s capital Kyiv (Russian Kiev) into a dramatic industrial metropolis. By 1960, Kyiv was a core industrial city with renovated prerevolutionary factories and massive new industrial enterprises. Ukraine’s 1991 independence threatened industrial complexes with demolition for retail, residential, and office uses. We examine Kyiv’s Soviet industrial legacy as prescribed in master plans of 1936 and 1947, and successive five-year plans. We profile five significant industrial complexes and their divergent fates today. We call for future transformations of Kyiv’s monumental Soviet industrial enterprises with enhanced awareness of heritage value. © 2020 The Author(s).

Here, the creation of ad hoc programmes for proposing, advancing and maintaining provisional public spaces in the city has challenged the essence of previously recognised bottom-up practices, contributing to hidden forms of spatial and social exclusion. The analysis of this case is an opportunity for critical reflection on the controversies and contradictions generated by the upscaling of what started as a way to claim rights over spaces and to raise the possibility of non-traditional forms of producing and maintaining the public space. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of 2020 drastically changed urban lifestyles. Workers were forced to minimize commuting to their workplaces, older adults were banned from using meeting facilities, and children were prohibited from going to school. The consequent lack of exercise, accumulated stress, and reduced well-being are likely to have become problems, which may be improved by using urban green spaces (UGS). This study clarified the characteristics of users of UGS in Tokyo during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on telecommuters, older adults, and families with children. An online questionnaire survey was conducted among Tokyo residents, and 3085 responses were obtained. A binomial logistic regression analysis was conducted with the use and evaluation of UGS as the objective variables. The results showed that older adults and families with children who had been using UGS before the pandemic and telecommuters who newly started using UGS during the pandemic used UGS differently. Older adults and families with children tended to use small parks and appreciated human connections. Telecommuters often used greenways, temples, and shrines, valuing stress-reducing functions. Given that a changing lifestyle brings new UGS users new preferences, urban planners should consider that UGS require change with the time. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This study aims to provide an overview of the pocket parks in the city centre of Kuala Lumpur while identifying the characteristics of the pocket parks associated with the visitation and usage. This study also intends to identify the constraints that limit the use of pocket parks according to Malaysia context. A survey conducted among N=363 respondents consisting of pocket parks users and non-users are presented and discussed. Overall the pocket parks in Kuala Lumpur are used by the respondents to rest and reduce stress. This study concluded that slightly more women use the pocket parks than men and lack of time was the main constraint that limited the use of pocket parks in Kuala Lumpur. A higher majority of respondents also cited their willingness to use the pocket parks more often if changes were implemented to make the pocket park safer and more facilities were provided. The findings contribute to an understanding of the factors that influence the usability pattern and constraints that limit the usage of pocket parks in Kuala Lumpur. Further, a well-managed and maintained pocket park would create opportunities for all segments of the urban community to use the parks more often. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Applying a pedestrian level of service in the context of social distancing: The case of the city of madrid
AU  - Talavera-Garcia, R.

T2  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a lot of discussion about keeping interpersonal distance to prevent the virus from spreading. To keep this interpersonal distance, authorities at different levels have taken measures to reduce people’s interactions, such as reducing capacities, curfews, pop-up cycle lanes, temporary pedestrianisation, and lockdowns. Many of these temporary measures have been perceived from a static view. Nevertheless, in a scenario of “new normality” or in the face of a possible new pandemic, the amount of data (big data) generated by different sources, such as sensors, in large cities has extraordinary potential to be used together with tactical urbanism for quick adaptation. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the aforementioned issues by analysing spatio-temporal patterns of pedestrian mobility and developing a variation of the pedestrian level of service measure; the pandemic pedestrian level of service (P-PLOS). This measure provides a dynamic view of pavement capacities according to the interpersonal distance recommendations during the pandemic. P-PLOS was tested in the city of Madrid based on the pedestrian counter data that was provided by the local government through its open data website. We found that the application of P-PLOS, together with street design, allows for knowing where and when it is necessary to take tactical urbanism measures in order to maintain or improve the level of service, as well as where it is necessary to take measures to reduce pedestrian flow. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Planning and Design Considerations for Birds and Butterflies´ Diversity of Small Urban Parks: A Case of Petaling Jaya, Malaysia

AB  - While most previous research has been conducted in large urban parks, the potential of small parks as urban habitats remains largely unexplored, particularly in tropical regions. The purpose of this paper is to provide landscape architects, planners, park managers and municipalities with recommendations for planning, design and management with the aim to enhance small urban parks’ biodiversity. Physical characteristics, vegetation and human factors are the important features that were highlighted using empirical data from nine small urban parks in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia sized between 0.5-3.5 hectares. Birds and butterflies are used as ecological indicators because they are relatively easy to identify and show clear responses to environmental change. Pearson’s correlations and multiple regressions, followed by an analysis of the Akaike’s Information Criterion were conducted to study the relationships between the measured variables, and to identify which of the variables have a significant effect on bird and butterfly species richness and abundance. The results demonstrate that the percentage of canopy cover, park size and native vegetation are the best predictors of bird species richness and abundance. Meanwhile, the butterfly species richness and abundance can be best predicted by the percentage of canopy cover, shrub species and native vegetation. Based on these results and the identification of key features for bird and butterfly richness and abundance, nine recommendations are provided to improve biodiversity of small urban parks: (1) set minimum areas for a small urban park; 2) inclusion of water elements to support a wider range of species; (3) the application of internal patch-corridor-matrix features; (4) attention to the aspect of cleanliness and appearance of small parks; (5) the proportion of open and shaded areas; (6) the planting composition of trees, palms and shrubs should be designed not only with aesthetic functions, but also for biodiversity; (7) the vertical and horizontal layers of vegetation structures; (8) providing natural buffers for wildlife protection; and (9) creating unmanaged patches in sunny areas by using wildflowers. © 2020.

T2  - Revista de Gestao Ambiental e Sustentabilidade
AB  - Objective: To address the systemic contribution of Protegemos las escuelas program to the increase of public spaces, road safety and environmental quality; the enhancement of public facilities and their immediate surroundings; and the reduction of socio-environmental imbalances between neighborhoods. Methodology: Case study based on the analysis of the 25 school environments transformed in the first phase of the action, aiming to elaborate a taxonomy of the interventions. Relevance: The work discusses the paradigm shift that characterizes Barcelona in the last decade, based on the transition from the culture of “official grandiloquence” to the attention on acting in the small and the ordinary, a phenomenon inserted in the context of economic and health crisis, but also political and representative. Results: Verification of the existence of five types of squares, in isolated or combined occurrences, with better or worse performances. After eleven months of operation, the program has already been able to generate approximately 3,500 m2 of new public spaces for pedestrians in the school surroundings. Contributions: The work contributes to the enhancement of small-scale everyday public spaces, presenting a tactical urbanism experience focused on the creation of public spaces of permanence associated with the school network. Conclusion: Although the program is still in the testing phase, and the scope as well as the limitations for the field of urban design are yet to be fully revealed, it is possible to highlight different contributions that emphasize the various aspects present in tactical urbanism methodology. © 2021 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

AB  - Knowing the ecological requirements of bird species is essential for their successful conservation. We studied the niche characteristics of birds in managed small-sized green spaces in the urban core areas of southern (Kavala, Greece) and northern Europe (Rovaniemi, Finland), during the breeding season, based on a set of 16 environmental variables and using Outlying Mean Index, a multivariate ordination technique. Overall, 26 bird species in Kavala and 15 in Rovaniemi were recorded in more than 5% of the green spaces and were used in detailed analyses. In both areas, bird species occupied different niches of varying marginality and breadth, indicating varying responses to urban environmental conditions. Birds showed high specialization in niche position, with 12 species in Kavala (46.2%) and six species in Rovaniemi (40.0%) having marginal niches. Niche breadth was narrower in Rovaniemi than in Kavala. Species in both communities were more strongly associated either with large green spaces located further away from the city center and having a high vegetation cover (urban adapters; e.g., Common Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), European Greenfinch (Chloris chloris), Eurasian Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus)) or with green spaces located closer to the city center and having high gray area cover and anthropogenic disturbance level (urban exploiters; e.g., Western Jackdaw (Corvus monedula), House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), Eurasian Magpie (Pica pica)). The eleven species that were common to both study areas similarly used the environmental variables and had similar niches, indicating that birds respond similarly to urbanization irrespective of latitude. Sixteen species in Kavala and eleven species in Rovaniemi were identified as conservation priority species, based on their niche specialization level and conservation status. The management actions proposed for the conservation of priority species will also benefit other species with similar ecological requirements and ultimately help maintain diverse bird communities in small-sized green spaces in urban core areas. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Parks provide a range of ecosystem services and make major contributions to urban life. Improved environmental quality was observed in urban parks as pollutants and noise disperse. Numerical models were used to assess the role of various design elements in air pollution and noise attenuation in parks. The walls reduced pollutants and sound noticeably in its shadow. Dense conifers can trap pollutants in park borders and lower concentrations in interiors, but less efficient in noise reduction. A study of a design for a small urban park suggests principles for achieving lower user exposure to pollution and healthier park environment. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AU  - Apostolopoulou, E.

T2  - Urban Geography
AB  - In this paper, we aim to explore how community gardening can embed and foment grassroots resistance to the privatization of urban space in the current configuration of a prolonged socio-economic and ecological crisis in European cities. We focus on the emblematic case of the Hellinikon self-organized garden; a case of guerrilla gardening that emerged as part of a social movement against the real estate development of the former International Airport of Athens. Community gardening in Hellinikon emerged as a resistance struggle against a controversial urban regeneration plan that combined green gentrification with unsustainable development and as a prefigurative politics of radically different sociospatial and socionatural relationships. We argue that community gardening initiatives that are part of broader urban struggles and grassroots activism denote a radical practice that has the potential to challenge crisis-driven dispossessions and claim the right to the city through spatial autogestion. This theorization of community gardening can shed light on the emergence of a new era of urban politics where demands for the re-appropriation of urban space by its inhabitants coalesce with demands for radically different urban socionatures in crisis-ridden megacities linking struggles for the right to the city to struggles for the right to urban nature. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article explores the genesis of small parks in Tokyo following the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake. It sheds new light on an example of innovative urban design and post-disaster reconstruction, and highlights the growing place that children occupied in the minds of bureaucrats and urban planners. The small parks were designed for children first and foremost. Originally conceived as a means to increase space for school children to play and exercise, all 52 parks were strategically located beside primary schools. As the state's goals of social management expanded, however, officials increasingly recognized the potential to use small parks as sites of rest and guided recreation, as well as emergency refuge. A history of Tokyo's small parks thus offers a window in to the growing understanding about the relationship between the built environment, health and society in inter-war Japan. © Cambridge University Press 2019.

T2  - Urban Climate
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) is the best acknowledged climate-change related phenomenon also because it affects population health conditions in dense urban areas, even exacerbated during heat waves. While most of field studies are performed by means of permanent weather stations, this paper presents an intra-urban microclimate analysis through wearable sensing techniques for monitoring and characterizing granular peculiarities as perceived by urban pedestrians. The study is implemented in four areas of New York City presenting already mitigation techniques. These strategies are specifically analyzed from the pedestrians' perspective, who may walk along parks and sidewalks, to better study real boundary conditions responsible for thermal perception, even in those areas where vehicles are not allowed. A novel cluster analysis procedure is then carried out to perform data-driven identification of urban microclimate peculiarities in relation to its morphology (e.g. urban canyons etc.). Results show a non-negligible dependency from urban configuration both in winter and in summer. Measurements in the high-packed district winter daytime show a drop off of 0.6 °C in air temperature close to small parks. The packed low-rise district presents highest values of CO2, with respect to the other monitored areas both in winter and in summer. The same areas are automatically recognized through the data-driven clustering process. The data-driven approach may be therefore successfully integrated into classic measurements to investigate UHI and heat stress in dense anthropized areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: Small public urban green spaces (SPUGS) are important for human life-quality and for maintenance of biodiversity within urban landscapes. However, little is known about how local characteristics and spatial location are related to biodiversity inhabiting SPUGS in tropical cities. In this study, we aimed at assess how noise, vegetation aspects (local characteristics), distance from a major habitat patch and from water (spatial location) are related to the bird community (species composition, species richness, total abundance and feeding guilds) inhabiting SPUGS in a medium-sized Neotropical city (Rio Claro, Brazil). We expected local characteristics to be the most important variables influencing the bird community. Bird observations were conducted in 28 SPUGS (< 1 ha) and we used generalized linear models and a multi-model inference to assess the relationships between SPUGS’ attributes and the bird community. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to assess which SPUGS characteristics modulate species composition. We made 1,808 records of 75 bird species distributed in 26 families. Noise was negatively related to bird species richness, total abundance, and abundance of granivorous species. On the other hand, tree species richness presented positive relationships with bird species richness and total abundance. Noise and tree species richness also were responsible for modulating the composition of species inhabiting SPUGS. Therefore, we demonstrated that local characteristics modulate birds inhabiting SPUGS; while noise is a strong limiting factor for birds inhabiting these small green spaces, increasing tree species richness can enhance SPUGS’ ability in harboring a diverse bird community. Graphical abstract: Representation of the outcomes of our study: in Rio Claro (São Paulo, Brazil), small public urban green spaces (SPUGS) nearby quieter streets and with higher tree species richness harbor highly diverse bird communities. Noise was negatively related to bird species richness, total abundance and abundance of granivorous bird species, while tree species richness presented positive relationships with bird species richness and total abundance.

TI  - Beyond guerrilla urbanism: Can Batlló and the slowness of knowing, managing, and making
AU  - de la Peña, D.
T2  - Urban Design International
AB  - Guerrilla urbanism has enjoyed widespread popularity over the past decade, provoking a reconsideration of the conventional roles of technicians, designers, and citizens and prompting a surge of creative tactics for improving cities. Nonetheless, some inquietude has accompanied the movement’s success—namely concerns about superficial citizen engagement, a focus on immediacy versus sustainability, and a disregard for expertise. While unsanctioned urban design has always existed in cities and is unlikely to disappear, the challenges that this movement faces could limit its contributions to local communities, planning institutions, and the design professions. This paper evaluates a case in Barcelona called Can Batlló in order to introduce the potential of “slowness” for sustaining guerrilla urbanism. In what began in 2009 as a guerrilla social movement and continues to thrive as an autonomous community center, this project has avoided the pitfalls of superficiality, immediacy, and amateurism by connecting with larger processes that are designed to last. Three themes are highlighted to elucidate these connections: autoconeixement (self-knowing), autogestió (self-management), and autoconstrucció (self-building). As the case study shows, tactical approaches to city-making that are deployed within a larger strategic frameworks allow time for meaningful engagement, deliberative processes, and the promotion of craft and expertise. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.

T2  - Future Cities and Environment
AB  - Dubai was developed from Khor Dubai and the city always focuses on the development of waterfront as a public space. The urban waterfront in Dubai is a highly visible public space for recreational activities but also as an urban landscape for placemaking, environmental pollution reduction, and transportation. The objective of this study is to explore the direction of future development of the Dubai Water Canal. By analyzing the characteristics and behavioural patterns of canal users using a post-occupancy evaluation survey, the study presents the management plan necessary to improve the facility. As a methodology, Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) with two-step cluster analysis was used with SPSS Statistics version 20.0. Dubai Water Canal users were classified into friend-based, family-based, and individual-based clusters to investigate the differences in satisfaction levels and perception between clusters. The survey included questions on accessibility, convenience of use, facility management status, safety, and landscape management. The result had shown that family-only parking, convenient pedestrian walkway, signage/ distance marker, and pocket parks as green buffer zones are needed to increase the level of satisfaction. Factors to enhance users’ satisfaction comprised 1) efficient road system for light exercise, 2) efficient information signage, 3) convenient pedestrian roads with nighttime lighting system, 4) strict separa-tion of pedestrians and cyclists, and 5) nature-friendly landscape and landscape improvement. This study intended to extract elements for future design and management of urban open space projects, similar to the Dubai Water Canal. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Recently, pocket green spaces (PGS), i.e., small green spaces, have attracted growing attention for their various ecological and social services. As a crucial part of urban green spaces in high-density urban areas, PGS facilitates recreation and relaxation for neighborhoods and thus improves the livability of cities at the local scale. However, whether and how the PGS cools the urban heat island effect is still unclear. This research was performed in the highly developed areas of the city of Shanghai during hot summer daytime. We applied a set of cooling effect indicators to estimate the cooling extent, cooling intensity, and cooling efficiency of PGS. We further examined whether and how landscape features within and surrounding the PGS influence its cooling effects. The results showed that 90% of PGS are cooler than their surroundings. Among the landscape features, the land surface temperature of PGS logarithmically decreased with its area, and the maximum local cool island intensity and maximum cooling area logarithmically increased with the area of PGS. The vegetation types and their composition within the PGS also influenced their surface temperature and the cooling effect. The PGS dominated by tree-shrub-grass showed the highest cooling efficiency. The surrounding landscape patterns, especially the patch density and the landscape shape index, influence the cooling effect of PGS at both class and landscape levels. These findings add new knowledge on factors influencing the cooling effect of PGS, and provide the biophysical theoretical basis for developing nature-based cooling strategies for urban landscape designers and planners. © Copyright © 2021 Wu, Li, Wang, Song, Haase, Breuste and Finka.

AB  - Observational studies have suggested that people with better access to attractive, safe, and inclusive blue spaces enjoy higher psychological well-being, with particular benefits for those living in deprived urban areas. However, intervention studies are scarce. To help bridge this gap we conducted a repeat cross-sectional study exploring local resident and visitor well-being before and after a small-scale intervention aimed at improving the quality of an urban beach area in a deprived neighbourhood in Plymouth, United Kingdom. Physical alterations were co-created with local stakeholders and residents, and accompanied by a series of on-site community events. Key outcomes were self-reported psychological well-being, satisfaction with personal safety and community belonging, and perceptions of site quality. Adjusted linear models showed that positive well-being (B = 7.42; 95% CI = 4.18–10.67) and life satisfaction (B = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.11–0.70) were both higher after the intervention compared to before, with associations for life satisfaction stronger among those who visited the site in the last four weeks. Associations with positive well-being were partially mediated by greater satisfaction with community belonging; and associations with life satisfaction were partially and independently mediated by greater satisfaction with personal safety and community belonging. Although caution needs to be taken due to the repeat cross-sectional design and the sampling of site visitors as well as local residents, the findings support the idea that environmental improvements to urban blue spaces can foster better psychological well-being, and underline the importance of community involvement in the process. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Grassroots movements - the activisms associated with the greening of the cities, reclaiming wastelands, establishing community gardens, improving the quality of life in industrialized places through minor nature-based interventions, as well as protection and safeguarding of the scraps of nature within cities - are what in this article I call green guerilla. I want to demonstrate how these small-scale grassroots movements grow; how their actions lead to official solutions; how they become institutionalized and, sometimes, commercialized. However, above all, by linking them with the environmental and participatory aesthetic trends, I wish to indicate their aesthetic aspects and the fact that they frequently bear the hallmarks of art. © 2021 University of Barcelona.

TI  - Early warning signs of population irruptions in Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus)
AU  - Wilson, M.

T2  - Ecological Management and Restoration
AB  - Left unchecked, macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) can exhibit irruptive population dynamics, rising rapidly to a peak, then crashing when overwhelmed by inadequate resources. This predictable population trajectory frequently leads to overabundance issues, particularly in peri-urban parks and nature reserves. Management decisions are usually guided by estimates of population density, which can be difficult to obtain, sometimes inaccurate and often inadequate because long-term data are needed to estimate population growth. Alternatively, density-dependent vital rates could be used to predict the growth trajectory of a population before management issues become evident. We applied a framework of sequential changes in vital rates to examine potential indicators of population growth trajectory. We sampled 16 populations of Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) in south-eastern Australia. Using a range of methods, we measured one vital rate (female reproductive rate) and one surrogate rate (adult sex ratio). As population density increased before irruptive peaks, female reproductive rate (90% breeding) was higher than during post-peak declines (66% breeding). Similarly, sex ratios in increasing populations were at parity and then became more female-biased (65% females) after peaks. These variables are readily measured in small parks and reserves, and therefore offer promising indicators of population growth trajectory, which can be used to forecast management issues and initiate timely management actions. © 2021 Ecological Society of Australia and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

TI  - Home Garden With Eco-Healing Functions Benefiting Mental Health and Biodiversity During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review
AU  - Zhang, X.

T2  - Frontiers in Public Health
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to tremendous impacts on human lives and society, which are not only because of negative effects on people's mental health due to isolation policies and physical distance for mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but also because the incident post-acute sequelae of the coronavirus will cause mental disorders. A green environment is a health resource, which cannot only benefit human physical and mental health, but also increases biodiversity, contributes to flood mitigation, and cools urban areas. A home garden, as a kind of small green space, can provide ecosystem services with eco-healing functions in reducing mental stress during the isolation period of the COVID-19 pandemic through the garden itself and physical activities in it. Such an eco-healing approach within a mini-therapeutic landscape can also benefit biodiversity by enhancing plant diversity in residence and increasing biodiversity at a large scale. In this article, we propose a conceptual framework describing a home garden as “ecological medicine” with healing functions to improve mental health, as well as indirectly enhancing urban biodiversity. A home garden, as a mini-type of green landscape with biodiversity content, allows people to get close with nature so that it can promote comfortable and natural feelings during the pandemic. Furthermore, such an eco-healing home garden approach benefiting urban biodiversity can meet the challenges in maintaining environmental and mental health in post COVID-19 pandemic recovery, as well as preparing unknown next-surge risks with potential isolation regulations.

TI  - A Tale of Three Misters: The Effect of Water Features on Soundscape Assessments in a Montreal Public Space
AU  - Trudeau, C.
AU  - Steele, D.
AU  - Guastavino, C.
T2  - Frontiers in Psychology
AB  - The acoustic environments of small, central urban parks are often dominated by traffic sounds. Water sounds can be used to mitigate the negative impacts of unwanted sounds through masking. Studies comparing the effects of different water sounds are typically conducted using recordings in laboratory settings where ecological validity is limited. An urban redesign project in Montreal took the innovative approach of trying three sequential temporary designs of a new public square, each of which included a distinct water feature that produced a lightly-audible mist. Here we report on a field experiment evaluating the effect of the water feature in each of the three designs. Respondents (n = 274) evaluated their experience with the three different designs using questionnaires including soundscape (SSQP) and restorativeness scales, and perceived loudness. The results indicate a significant interaction effect between the water feature and the design of the space, particularly on ratings of chaotic and loud. While two water feature designs had an overall “positive” effect (i.e., less loud and chaotic) on soundscape assessment, the third water feature design produced the opposite effect. These findings hold even after accounting for ambient temperature. This opportunity to test multiple water features in the same space revealed that water features do not automatically improve soundscape assessments. The visual design, function of the space and environmental conditions should be carefully considered and calls for more field studies. We discuss consequences and considerations for the use of water features in public spaces as well as the implications in terms of ecological validity of soundscape studies. © Copyright © 2020 Trudeau, Steele and Guastavino.

T2  - International Journal of Arts and Technology
AB  - This paper offers a semiotic perspective on how play is used to change the citizens' perception of the city. The paper adopts a meaning-centred approach to playfulness (a resemantisation of the surrounding environment) and to urban spaces (complex meaning-making machines). It investigates the different ways citizens can reclaim their right to the city by writing or enunciating it and the role played by play in these dynamics in the context of a ludicising culture. After engaging a few examples of urban gamification [such as flash mobs and park(ing) day] the paper also engages the digital representations of the city and how also this dimension of the urban spaces is subject to forms of gamification. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - Over the past decade, open innovation (OI) literature has extended its scope beyond strictly economic contexts to the context of societal value creation. This has given rise to the notion of (local) distributed knowledge as a driver for sustainable innovation and has highlighted the importance of multi-stakeholder collaborations in new product development (NPD) processes to develop new ICT systems for complex urban issues. Several studies have discussed sustainable stakeholder ecosystem architectures for such collaborations. However, little is known about stakeholder identification and selection processes for collaborations in the urban environment. By combining action research with a case study design, this paper studies the nature of contextualized interactions between knowledge actors in the ecosystem and the processes of attraction, identification, selection, and activation of stakeholders in an urban living lab (ULL). These insights converge in the development of a ‘stakeholder acupuncture framework’, which structures mechanisms and practices within dynamic collaboration ecosystems and defines key boundary conditions for such open-ended ecosystems. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - A process of urban regeneration should be able to produce social and spatial contextual effects. In order to achieve long-term results, it has to guarantee social inclusion. New rising ways of transformation of public space, consisting in the urban co-design, are defining new tools able to trigger processes of regeneration so called “community-led”. One of the approaches used by different groups of architects to trigger regeneration processes of so-called “in need areas” is the activation of the community through urban laboratories of social innovation for the realization of temporary transformations of space. This article explores the analysis of DIY (Do It Yourself) Urbanism tools of co-planning and co-construction as motors of innovation, activation and social inclusion, investigating their role in urban regeneration. Questions are being asked about the new skills of the architect involved in these procedures and about possible tools useful to the institutions to act in these operative fields. The purpose is to analyze some practices, hypothesizing their replicability and applicability to different scales, in order to generate virtuous mechanisms. Two experiences of co-design and co-construction, located in two different geographic, social and political contexts, will be shown: the construction of the Casa de la lluvia (de ideas), in Bogotà(Colombia), and the regeneration of Piazza Gasparotto, in Padua (Italy). Despite the peculiarities of context, we want to illustrate the strategies implemented in the cases exposed, in order to identify shared features and differences due to the degrees of freedom that the participation tools must have, to be flexible and repeatable. © 2020 WITPress.

AB  - University campuses, as important elements of urban greenery, are related with a positive impact on student health and well-being. They provide unique possibilities for estimating biodiversity change. This study focused on the biodiversity in the Campus. The study aimed at: assessing the plant biodiversity occurring in the park; assessing the representation of native species and determining the frequency at which invasive species occur; as well as recommending an adaptation of the park management. The Park was sub-divided into biotopes and a phytocoenological relevé was recorded. Park projects create biodiversity islands that may contribute to improve urban space. A species composition that is close to natural vegetation creates a space for native species, which thus better adapt to living in urban conditions. Localities created by humans, which imitate natural ecosystems, increase the biodiversity and are valuable natural islands in cities. The semi-natural phytocoenoses however, do not resist the occurrence of invasive plant species. Regarding the small size of the studied park, manual elimination or cutting of invasive plant species is sufficient © 2022. Journal of Ecological Engineering.All Rights Reserved

AB  - The perception of the quality of green and blue spaces can be key in the relationship between a community and its local landscape (i.e., place identification). The lack of transdisciplinary training and social-specific education of landscape architects regarding the complexity of landscape as a participative cultural artefact limits reaching the general population. Bridging this gap of landscape and place identification and evaluation by a local community was the main objective of the present case study conducted at an abandoned spring and seasonal stream area in Rubí (Spain). The “Steinitz method” of landscape evaluation was used as a participatory method to activate community members to learn about and express their visual preferences regarding this neglected landscape. Bottom-up interventions applying an “urban acupuncture” approach in the area identified as the least attractive by the residents were co-designed and combined with a top-down restoration of a nearby, existing but derelict and hidden, spring. In addition, before and after planning and implementing the intervention, we conducted surveys about the community perception, sense of belonging and use of the space. We observed that the lack of awareness of the inhabitants about this spring was an obstacle preventing the community from embracing the potential for health and wellbeing presented by the spring and adjacent landscape. Following the work, the landscape saw increasing use, and the historic spring was brought back to life as a resource to help people to improve their health and wellbeing. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Exploring Affecting Factors of Park Use Based on Multisource Big Data: Case Study in Wuhan, China
AU  - Ye, Y.

T2  - Journal of Urban Planning and Development
AB  - The exploration of park use and its affecting factors is necessary for urban park planning and management. Using big data, 70 urban parks in Wuhan were selected as the study objects in the present study. Two groups of linear regression models were developed to examine the effects of various factors on park use. The total numbers of visits and public demands in urban parks were recorded as 1,291,894 and 4,022, respectively. Social media data reflect visits, while public demand data reflect demands. First, a large area and sufficient facilities greatly help improve park use; moreover, we should pay attention to old urban parks in disrepair. More squares need to be considered in urban parks; attention should be paid to the water pollution and safety concerns that may arise in urban parks. Second, the influence of accessibility on park use is stable. It is beneficial for park use to construct greenways connecting residential areas and urban parks. The layout of pocket parks in the city center is also a feasible way to improve park use. Third, to improve park use, we should arrange commercial entertainment facilities and services in urban parks in point of interest (POI)-rich areas, as well as facilities and services for residents' daily activities in urban parks in population-rich areas. This study provides a way to combine multisource data that reflect the number of park visits and park demands to explore affecting factors of park use. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Pocket parks: Urban living rooms for urban regeneration
AU  - Hamdy, M.

T2  - Civil Engineering and Architecture
AB  - Urban parks are mostly implemented as large green-infrastructural projects exclusive to recreational activities and economies. Currently, 54% of the global population is urban and is projected to increase to 68% by 2050 (UN 2012). This entails the need for a more sustainable approach towards food production, movement and overall living together in cities. Micro-scale communal spaces could potentially prompt such goal. They are often most effective when they utilize abandoned or ill-used urban voids; transforming them into pocket parks. This paper frames pocket parks as a potential first step towards both: Sustainable urban regeneration, and equal access to public spaces in dense cities. It hypothesizes pocket parks as an answer to economic crisis, food production pressure, run-down communities and the lack of development land for communal spaces. It highlights their key implementation challenges. Also, the influence of communities’ contextual needs on pocket parks’ size, design, activities and funding is investigated by comparing selected international projects. Reflecting on the Mediterranean context, case studies from Cairo, Egypt and Tirana, Albania are analyzed and room for further implementation is discussed. Finally, the paper concludes with some recommendations to overcome their implementation challenges in commercial city centers and mixed-use residential areas. © 2021 by authors, all rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we highlight some of the challenges associated with strategic spatial planning, including long-time frames, limited control, translation and implementation gaps. We then explore how tactical urbanism might, in theory, address these s given its emphasis on small-scale, immediate, experimental action for long-term change. Our research with a Charter-based, principles-led, action-oriented network is then used to test these possibilities in practice. We conclude that tactical urbanism can be considered the antithesis of, complement to, or antidote depending on the disposition of planning authorities. © 2021 The Author(s).

AU  - da Cruz MOSCARELLI, F.
T2  - Space and Culture
AB  - Communities living in Latin American slums present more vulnerability of diseases, high rates of infant mortality, and low life expectancy, generally as a result of the high levels of soil contamination. Furthermore, in our case study of the 4th District of Porto Alegre, the community depends on recycling materials from waste for their livelihood. In consequence, the public spaces are used as a garbage dump, accentuating health problems and making social interactions difficult. In this context, our applied research group aims to construct social spaces, improving the inhabitants’ quality of life through participative methodologies that encourage the use of the public spaces of these districts without prejudice of the economic system based on garbage. Our strategy relies on the actions and interactions of humans and the place in sub developed urban areas. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This study is aimed at quantifying the contribution of small urban green spaces to mitigate adverse bioclimatic conditions within the urban environment of Athens during summer and investigate their thermal profile during a warm, a cold and a transitional period. Six green and non-green sites inside a typical urban cluster in the city of Athens were selected and monitored. Descriptive statistics data were calculated and evaluated for air temperature values and air temperature differences measured at a reference site. Statistical analysis was carried out in order to examine potential statistically significant differences. Results showed that vegetated sites showed a stronger cool island pattern compared to non-vegetated open spaces during the warm period whereas the effect is minimized during the cold period. During the transitional period vegetated and non-vegetated shaded locations was found to present similar heat island pattern. © 2021 Global NEST.

T2  - Urban Design International
AB  - The paper portrays the Plazuela de la Campana, a historical small square in the Port of Veracruz, Mexico that fell into ill-use and was revived with a strategy of music and dance events. The case demonstrates how music and dance became a new tradition that nurtures a collective attachment to the Plazuela and contributes to it being regarded as heritage. The privately initiated revitalisation borrows potency from prior nostalgic memories and traditions to overpower the past notoriety of the square. Dance and music, besides creating pleasant associations, effectively build a network of friendships that engages people in the square and through which the history of the place becomes remembered. All these effects deepen the meaningfulness of the Plazuela, which fosters personal affection towards the square and ultimately, it is proposed, translates into a general appreciation—a lesson to be learned for emerging urban planning practices. © 2020, The Author(s).

AU  - Bach, C.E.
AU  - McClintock, N.
T2  - Environment and Planning C: Politics and Space
AB  - Unsanctioned guerrilla gardens, long a feature of North American cities, are frequently planted as radical challenge to conventional urban land use. Over the past decade, a number of community-led garden projects – projets citoyens – have appeared on sidewalks and in vacant lots, and alleys of Montreal, Quebec’s inner-core neighborhoods under the banner of “appropriating” or “reclaiming” urban space. In this article, we examine the rise of these DIY (do-it-yourself) garden projects and the extent to which they have been institutionalized via municipal agencies and NGOs. We find the distinction between institutionalized and guerrilla projects to be quite blurry, and ask whether such spaces – and the social relations forged within and between them – are able to effectively challenge hegemonic abstract space (as conceived by Lefebvre) and contribute to a radical democratic urban politics (as conceived by Rancière). We conclude that the power of these projects to transform capitalist urban space and challenge the dominant socio-spatial order is limited. We argue, however, that their transformative potential lies instead in their functioning as spaces of political subject formation, where participants collaboratively articulate counter-hegemonic imaginaries and master the skills of collective autogestion – albeit only for a small and relatively homogenous group of Montrealers. Critical attention to absent and silenced voices and self-reflexive awareness of historical and contemporary processes of exclusion and displacement are crucial in order for these projects to become truly radical democratic spaces. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In a cultural landscape, old historical parks feature important biodiversity refuges not only for vascular plants but also for bryophytes. Here, we surveyed a total of 14 historical parks and gardens in urban and rural areas of Slovakia to evaluate their bryophyte diversity and to find out possible correlations between species richness and habitat characteristics. Overall, 104 bryophyte species (12 liverworts and 92 mosses) were identified. Most frequently occurring species were Amblystegium serpens, Brachythecium rutabulum, Bryum argenteum and Tortula muralis, present at all studied sites. Generally, small urban parks hosted less bryophyte species compared to rural areas. In terms of substrate preference, most frequent were epigeic species, followed by epilithic, epiphytic and epixylic species. At most sites, species’ indicator values showed a dominance of semi-heliophilous, semi-heliophobic, hygrophilous, weakly acidophilous to basiphilous bryophyte taxa. Spearman rank correlation test showed that the species richness correlated with the park location (urban vs. rural area) and the number of settlement inhabitants showing that green areas in urban landscape are more isolated from each other which decreased species richness. Our results show that old parks and gardens can provide suitable habitats for some rare species such as Osculatia bornholmensis (reported recently as new for Slovakia) but even for common forest and meadow species and the study of their diversity should be given an increased attention. © 2020, Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The essay critically addresses several solutions and strategies for tackling urban inequalities to uphold the recent “right to the ‘healthy’ city” spatial paradigm based on early social science works by Emily Skinner and Jeffrey R. Masuda (2013) and then developed as a urban planning component by the interdisciplinary research group Barcelona Lab for Urban Environmental Justice and Sustainability (2019). The authors propose a transdisciplinary approach in dealing with city renewal-regeneration and the safer use of its spaces. The interrelation between urbanism and architecture, including environmental design, mobility, and social relations, among others, would merge to imagine a more ecologically and socially balanced urban milieu. The paper analyses four specific case studies assumed as proper approaches in dealing with the pandemic, critically reflecting on the application of “Superblocks,” “Tactical Urbanism,” and “15-minute City” concepts by illustrating and comparing their application in three global cities (respectively Barcelona, Beijing, and Milan). In a nutshell, the authors demonstrate that these policies have their crucial feature in being effective applications formulated for different contexts, proposing successful strategies to overcome health, environment, and mobility issues in all the contemporary global cities. © 2020, Maggioli S.p.a..

T2  - Acta Scientiarum Polonorum, Administratio Locorum
AB  - Motives: Urban green spaces have many functions in cities. They are used for recreational purposes, and they contribute to improving social interactions and community cohesiveness. For this reason, the location and area of urban green spaces should correspond to the size of the city and its population. Aim: The main aim of this study was to analyze the accessibility of managed and publicly available urban green spaces, referred to as public urban green spaces (PUGS), in four functional and spatial zones in the city of Białystok. The analysis included parks, green squares (pocket parks, ornamental green squares, boulevards) and public forests. The accessibility of PUGS was determined in view of their size and role in the urban spatial structure. Spatial data were processed in GIS and quantitative analyses. Results: The study demonstrated that the area of PUGS per capita meets the requirements of the World Health Organization (WHO), but the area of parks and green squares should be increased. The accessibility buffers of public green spaces often overlapped, in particular in downtown Białystok (Central zone) which is most abundant in these green infrastructure components. The analysis also revealed locations that do not have access to urban green spaces. The results of the study were used to formulate guidelines for incorporating new green spaces in Białystok and improving the urban spatial structure.

AU  - Cariello, A.

AU  - Rotondo, F.
T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - The paper aims to evaluate the value that the experimentation of tactical urban planning activities can assume for the city, through the critical account of some practices in three Italian cities of large (Milan), medium-large (Bari), and medium size (Taranto), which in recent years, in some cases unknowingly, have experienced its effects, also forced by the thrust offered by the need to respond to the consequences of the pandemic. The authors reflect on how short-term interventions started by tactical urbanism movement are inspiring planning institutions to implement short-term place-making initiatives. The contribution moves within the context of new generation urban regeneration in which the transformation of existing spaces is a process of community reconstruction through the redevelopment of public spaces increasingly open to multiple and temporary uses. First through a process of rereading the state of the art of the project of public spaces in Italy and its transformation caused by the pandemic, then through a comparative look between the three case studies, conclusions are drawn on the urban value of the experiments conducted and, on their ability, to identify a new reference point for the sustainable urban regeneration of public spaces. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Community blemish or new dawn for the public realm? Governance challenges for self-claimed gardens in urban China
AU  - Zhu, J.

AU  - Thompson, S.
T2  - Cities
AB  - In China, self-claimed vegetable lots are emerging in urban communities through the appropriation of public green lands, a paralleled ‘guerrilla gardening’ phenomenon. However, disputes and conflicts arise due to the contested method of garden acquisition. Moreover, these gardens are rather stigmatised due to the urban-biased regulations embedded in China's aggressive urbanisation agenda, indicating the gap between grassroots spatial demand and top-down regulations. Using the case of Hangzhou, this paper aims to understand the governance challenges of self-claimed gardens in urban China through stakeholder interviews and survey. Findings reveal that the attitudes, interests and influences of gardeners, non-gardeners and community officials contribute to a cyclical spatial transformation between green land and gardens. The stigmatisation of and conflicts around gardens result from both an unfair stereotype of ‘uncivilised behaviour’ and inconsiderate ways of growing vegetables. The case study has also demonstrated that gardens have provided benefits in setting up social ties and strengthening a sense of community in China's high-density built environment. The governance structure of gardens should be shifted with the help of planning system refinement to de-stigmatise and legitimise gardening and increase the promising possibility of gardens becoming a new dawn for the public realm. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AU  - Xing, Y.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Air quality in small urban parks improves rapidly with distance from surrounding streets. This arises because air pollutants disperse within parks where there are few sources. This was traditionally thought to arise from pollutant uptake by trees, but they can also reduce wind speed and potentially trap pollutants. It is increasingly evident that relatively little pollution is absorbed by trees over short distances typical of small urban parks. Nevertheless, trees and park infrastructure, also constrain the distribution of park users and thus lower their exposure. In this paper, we explore the exposure to traffic-derived air pollutants in the Hong Kong parks (Sha Tin and Sham Shui Po) and examine the way in which PM2.5 concentration and user distribution is affected by the spatial layout of park features. The modelled pollutant distribution was validated against measurements made in Sha Tin Park. Population-weighted exposure to traffic-derived pollution was quantified by overlapping pollutant and park user distribution. The results reveal how different design features (i.e. vegetation, earth berms and recreation areas) affect exposure during individual time period; most positively in Sha Tin Park where the design leads to a >50% reduction in exposure, early morning. In Sham Shui Po Park, exposure increases as park users are often attracted to facilities near a busy trunk road. This study reveals the heterogeneity of park user exposure to traffic-derived air pollution, which leads to uncertainty in health benefits provided by urban parks and suggests fine-scale exposure considered in thoughtful park design. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Urbani Izziv
AB  - The article deals with the fragile connection that public spaces often have with their context. In this regard, the use of urban acupuncture in leftover space can be an opportunity to revitalize the urban fabric through small-scale interventions developed in accordance with community preferences. This study evaluates interventions in vacant plots based on both residents' preferences and experts' opinions. Using the example of leftover space in Tehran, this article explores public preferences and priorities regarding urban acupuncture from a social, design, and aesthetic perspective, applying a descriptive-analytical method. The opinions of six experts were examined and categorized in the first phase. In the second phase, the topics and subtopics extracted from the first phase were incorporated into visual questionnaires to evaluate preferences, from which 165 valid responses were obtained. Following the analysis of the questionnaires, twenty-two personal interviews were carried out. The results show which interventions are preferred over others. © 2020 Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Within the BlueHealth project, funded under the Horizon 2020 European Union research framework, a number of targeted experimental design interventions created in virtual reality (VR) were used to test the effect and impact of planning and design on encouraging people to use various blue spaces. A set of designs in three different coastal landscape types—a cliff/steep slope; a sandy beach and an area of reed beds—located in Tallinn, Estonia, were used as the sites for nine different intervention designs. The designs were based on a combination of the site features and inspirations from solutions found in different locations internationally. Using 3D modelling and a Virtual Reality system, a set of nine videos, one to depict each intervention, was created and shown to a quota sample of 252 Estonian residents. Respondents were asked a set of questions associated with each option. The results were analysed statistically and qualitatively. The results uncovered key preferences for designs and revealed differences among age groups and the levels of personal interconnection with nature. However, there were problems associated with the interpretation and understanding of some of the options by some of the people due to the degree of realism of the VR representations, which may have affected the results. The project shows that VR could be a useful tool for testing design ideas as part of public participation approaches but that care is needed in ensuring that viewers understand what they are assessing. © 2020 by the authors.

AU  - Wen, L.

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - This paper explores the relationship between crowding and streets as public open spaces in high-density urban environments from the perspectives of perceived density and human needs, two antecedents to crowdedness. City streets are the places through which various forms of crowding are perceived and experienced. Hence, they can play a role in easing this sense of crowding if corresponding strategies are put in place. The paper argues that practices, such as traffic calming and self-building, can transform the streets to serve as public open space, which increases spaciousness and eases crowding. It also puts forward tactical urbanism as a strategy for city governance to create the right conditions encouraging flourishing civil society initiatives in a dense primary environment that is invigorating and at the same time has a level of crowding perceived as both comfortable and liveable. © 2020 by the authors.

AU  - Cruz, S.

T2  - International Journal of the Commons
AB  - Our study focuses on the challenges facing sustainable urban mobility in the megacity of Sao Paulo. We aim to explore the panorama of active mobility initiatives, proposing to analyze the relationship between urban commons and innovation in public services. We selected the Reduced Speed Zone and Complete Street initiatives, which aim to improve road safety conditions (public services focused on common infrastructure), active mobility and access to public transport, and may also potentially help to reduce noise levels, improve air quality (social dilemmas/ common issues/negative externalities) and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (global commons). Based on an analytical model for interpreting innovation in services, considering competences and techniques originating from the provider (municipal government) and users (through civil society organizations), our findings identified innovations at a local level within infrastructure treatment for pedestrians. These public services were introduced in a participatory process and a collective re-appropriation of urban space. The projects contribute to the development of service provider competences, related to various interactions with civil society, resulting in a systemic view with regard to the uses, local dynamics and behavioral aspects of the users themselves. Service provider techniques may be both temporary and permanent intervention methodologies, besides methodologies for project impact evaluations. These techniques are associated with tactical urbanism as a technique for temporary urban interventions. User techniques were identified for application of the propensity score-matching method, which aims to evaluate the impacts of an instance of intervention through the comparison of groups, as well as through technical inspections and local interviews. The relationship management generated relational and organizational competences for civil society organizations. However, despite the advances indicated by the analyzed experiences of active mobility – highlighting the role of civil society organizations – and by some progress made in the regulatory framework, innovative practices have been restricted to the treatment of infrastructure for pedestrians, a change of speed limit for vehicles, and horizontal signaling to mark the perimeter of these areas. Therefore, there is a large-scale potential for the continued introduction of innovations regarding the improvement and scale gains of public services for pedestrian mobility, promoting participatory restructuring as a form of (re)appropriation of urban public spaces by its own users, improving the current negative externalities and social costs of urban mobility. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of this study is to regenerate the Portuense district of Rome, in the southwest quadrant of the city, referring to nature-based solutions (NBS) coupled with sustainable solutions in rainwater management. The role of water, both as a resource and as an essential element of urban landscape, was considered. Nature-based solutions include several concepts or technologies ranging from blue-green infrastructure to water saving measures to sustainable rainwater drainage, and their use can be an important tool to mitigate the negative effects of climate change. To this end, high levels of integration between experts from different disciplines are necessary, specifically urban planners, water engineers and ecologists, and the involvement of land and water managers, planners and policy makers on all spatial scales is required. The design solutions in this work were developed following the United Nations 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and fitting the following models of city [1]: The Oasis City where NBS solutions improve the thermal well-being of the inhabitants reducing the heat island effect (environmental function); the City of Sponges to increase soil permeability and control rainwater flow making more sustainable the urban drainage system (environmental function); the City for People to improve the liveability and sociability of the spaces (social function). Based on these principles, three design solutions, called prototypes, have been developed: Pocket Park (environmental function), Main Avenue (social functions), Tiber Park (environmental and social functions). The biotope area factor, BAF index, was used here as the main measure to evaluate the effectiveness of the design solutions. The solutions proposed in each prototype can be repeated for all the interventions conceived in the "network of spaces" of the Portuense district. © 2021 WITPress. All rights reserved.

TI  - From “streets for traffic” to “streets for people”: can street experiments transform urban mobility?
AU  - Bertolini, L.
T2  - Transport Reviews
AB  - Despite their growing application and worldwide diffusion, the transformative potential of experiments aimed at achieving “streets for people” rather than “streets for traffic” remains largely under researched. There is little to no comparative assessment of already existing experiments, and no critical reflection on their specific added value for systemic change. Building from a literature review and discussion, this paper aims to fill this gap by addressing the following questions: Which types of city street experiments have been undertaken in the pursuit of the vision of “streets for people” instead of “streets for traffic”? What are their backgrounds, main characteristics, and reported impacts? And perhaps most importantly: How can these city street experiments trigger systemic change in urban mobility? These elements are detailed per experiment type, in order of ascending functional complexity: the re-marking of streets, the re-purposing of car parking, the re-purposing of sections of streets, and the re-purposing of entire streets. Illustrative examples from practice include intersection repairs, parklets, the pavement to plazas programme, play streets, ciclovias and open streets. The reviewed literature documents positive impacts on physical activity, active transportation, safety and social interaction and capital, and more mixed impacts on business activity. While street experiments aim to create fundamentally different arrangements of urban mobility, their potential as triggers of a greater systemic change is unclear. This paper uses the defining characteristics of “transition experiments”–a concept derived from the field of transition studies–to develop and illustrate a framework to assess this transformative potential. In the conclusions, the review and assessment framework are used to sketch a research and policy agenda for this increasingly topical phenomenon. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The crisis resulting from the spread of COVID-19 is having important consequences on the development of the contemporary city, notably in the rethinking of public and collective spaces. To avoid contagion, restrictive measures and social distancing have been put in place: the two main consequences have been the digitalization of many sectors and the spread of tactical urbanism actions. In this paper, it will be argued that hyperlocal, understood as a collective and participatory design facilitated by information technology, can be a solution not only to the ongoing emergency but to the challenges that contemporary society poses, since it appears to be a valuable practice in rethinking and redesigning our neighborhoods and cities in a more open, inclusive, and therefore more resilient way © 2021,ArchiDOCT All Rights Recerveds

TI  - Towards a framework for facilitating the implementation of Tactical Urbanism Practices: Assessment Criteria in the Place-making Approach in Iran
AU  - Lak, A.
AU  - Zarezadeh Kheibari, S.
T2  - Geoforum
AB  - One of the significant issues in developing countries like Iran is the decreased feasibility of place-making projects in urban development because the majority of urban design projects are top-down, high-cost, and long-term, thereby taking them years to be implemented. Even when implemented after a long time, these projects usually do not meet the users' demands of urban space as a result of the passage of time. Tactical urbanism (TU) has been recently proposed as a possible solution to facilitate place-making and promote “right to the city” in cities. This study aims to develop a framework for facilitating the implementation of TU projects in the Iranian context in the shadow of big government power. For fast and easy implementation of TU practices, a set of criteria was extracted from the literature and TU practices. All these criteria were validated with a panel of 20 experts of urban planning and design as well as local authorities using the Delphi technique to determine the most suitable ones for the proposed framework. The findings suggest that the TU facilitated criteria in the framework can be classified into six broad dimensions, namely, functional, experimental-aesthetic, environmental, social, governance and monitoring, and economic criteria. This framework has the potential to provide guidelines for TU practices on small-scale and informal place-making interventions based on citizens' needs in developing countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AU  - Carraz, R.
AU  - Merry, A.
T2  - Journal of Urban Design
AB  - Social segregation, limited opportunities for interaction and increasing semi-private public spaces, largely contribute to underused public areas of the city. This paper argues that playful design experiences achieve more than aesthetic outcomes. Implemented as ‘tools’ for personal, social and spatial enhancement, they allow user engagement in exciting and responsive environments. A case study on Cyprus’ capital, Nicosia, demonstrates an event which acted as a catalyst for improved spatial usage, increased sociability, and lasting changes. Playful designs therefore have the potential to change user opinions and create new links between users and places, allowing positive experiences within previously underutilized public spaces. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Micro-regeneration is a gradual renewal strategy that uses small-scale interventions to improve the quality of the living environment and local community, as well as spur industrial development. It is the small-scale interventions that have continued to make micro-regeneration a viable economic rural renewal approach for traditional village conservation and development. As such, in this work we explore potential micro-regeneration strategies and promotions based on assessments of public perception and preferences in an “unlisted” traditional village in China (i.e., an area with limited investment for conservation compared to “listed”, renowned traditional villages). We aim to identify the most perceptible modes of village transformation and industrial development for rural micro-regeneration strategies in the Huangshan traditional village of China. We also tested how the social character of respondents significantly affected their preferences in this regard. The public participatory mapping results illustrated a spatially clustered pattern made up of small spaces and individual buildings demanding micro-regeneration interventions. The survey based on 150 residents living around these sites disclosed that a unified repair approach subsidized by government and traffic condition improvements are the most recognized modes of village transformation, and the tourism is the most perceived and preferred method for industrial development. Significant differences between public perceptions and preferences of both village transformation and industrial development were identified corresponding to gender and income demographics, while village transformation perceptions change is dependent on age. Therefore, our study demonstrates evidence-based recommendations for active and effective rural micro-regeneration practices. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

T2  - International Journal of Tourism Cities
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the art-based project of Full Llove Inn as a tactical urbanism intervention and urban tourist attraction. The project consisted of an elevated room-car, displayed in the public space of Amsterdam from August 2006 to September 2007. Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted between December 2017 and November 2018 in Amsterdam. The study applied the methodological tools of semi-structured interviews, textual analysis and participatory observation. Findings: Full Llove Inn provided an extraordinary allure for visitors and residents. It created a sense of intra-personal and inter-personal existential authenticity for local and non-local guests, respectively, while introducing a pop-up hotel as a new form of tactical initiative. Research limitations/implications: Due to the inability to contact non-local guests for interviews, the only source of data was based on tourist experiences about Full Llove Inn derived from the hotel guest book. Practical implications: The research suggests that pop-up hotels may be used by Destination Management Organizations as a means of strengthening the brand image and creating a competitive edge for cities. Social implications: The research indicates that art-inspired tactical interventions in the public space of civic environments could constitute a social capital while generating interactions between residents and visitors. Originality/value: For the first time in the tourism literature, this study investigates the impact of tactical projects on destination branding from the perspective of both locals and visitors. © 2019, International Tourism Studies Association.

TI  - A new typology of pocket parks: Inspiring small spaces for changing cities
AU  - Babalis, D.
T2  - Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Urban Design and Planning
AB  - The contemporary city has witnessed sweeping changes in terms of structure and image. New glittering globalised urban forms emerged, however, associated 'anywhere' contemporary urban spaces are often criticised as bland and meaningless. The global crisis of 2008 brought with it a heightened realisation of the need to manage cities differently and more sustainably. In recent decades, the concept of a public space/garden has changed from something largely ornamental and often to be viewed 'passively' to creating spaces for 'active engagement' as well as, relaxation and socialisation, and with resultant positive impacts on community health and well-being. Small spaces have the potential to bring people together to create places of community cohesion, but they may also hold the key to addressing broader issues such as increasing biodiversity and repairing environmental damage. This study of pocket parks suggests that 13 distinct 'types' of pocket park have emerged since they were first identified as a special kind of urban space in the late 1960s. They now possess a wide range of spatial configurations and perform a variety of functions. However, these new possibilities need a variety of skills and knowledge to exploit them to their full potential and in pocket park creation.  © 2020 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.

AU  - Udelsmann Rodrigues, C.
T2  - International Journal of Urban Sustainable Development
AB  - Climate-related phenomena historically have had an impact on the lives of urban dwellers of Luanda and Maputo. Recently, however, urban expansion and congestion of different sorts, aggravated by climate change impacts, call for renewed responses on the part of residents. Rising sea levels and harder impacts of flooding are the most disturbing issues in the two coastal capitals, demanding both institutional responses and strategies of urban residents, particularly the most vulnerable. Based on qualitative data collected in Luanda and Maputo, this article describes how urban residents aim to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change and by doing so, shape the cities they live in and their environment. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of small urban spaces (or pocket parks) in cities as an opportunity to access nature and restorativeness. The study was performed in nine squares located in the central zone of the city of Madrid. A total of 537 people were interviewed in situ about their preferences, as well as the perceived quality and environmental restorativeness of these places. The results show that preference is influenced by the amount of vegetation and perceived restorativeness, and that restorativeness in turn is determined by perceived vegetation and social interaction. The benefits of this restorative role should be considered when designing small urban squares, taking care to include plants and vegetation as well as appropriate equipment, and making these spaces a valuable element within the green infrastructure of major cities. © 2016 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.

TI  - Re-naturing cities: reducing flood risk through nature-based solutions
AU  - Gearey, M.
T2  - Geography
AB  - Climate change is already reshaping the environments within which we live. From regional impacts, such as increased frequency, severity and duration of extreme weather events in the form of wildfires and hurricanes, to localised events in the form of riverine flooding and coastal storm surges, different disciplinary professionals all recognise that adaptation to a warming planet needs urgent attention and action. This article examines how emerging scholarship around ‘re-naturing cities’ could support societal transformation in the face of uncertain futures. The first section discusses the concept of ‘flood risk management’ (FRM) from its emergence from (and beyond) flood prevention strategy principles, and examines the reasons why FRM's current approach only goes so far in supporting adaptation strategies. The second section explores the rationale behind re-naturing cities, particularly in light of global urbanisation, to interrogate how using green infrastructure (GI) and nature-based solutions (NBS) can enrich the FRM discourse's ‘toolbox’ to help reduce flood risk–both for city dwellers and those living and working in periurban and hinterland environments. Using case studies of strategies for re-naturing cities around the world that directly address flood risk, including arboreal avenues, pocket parks, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) and reconstructed urban wetlands, the article concludes with a brief reflection on how feasible, equitable and sustainable the re-naturing cities approach might be for our current and future global citizens. © Geography 2018.

AB  - The article discuss the conflicts, potentials and possible alliances of do-it-yourself (DIY) urbanism when it takes the form of spontaneous place appropriations, when it is performed as participatory urban design and when it is integrated strategically in planning. DIY urbanism and experimentation with participation are currently strong influential factors in Danish planning. The article explores the use of participatory DIY urban design in two cases: the relocation of beer drinkers in Enghave Square and the Carlsberg City development in Copenhagen, Denmark. Carlsberg City is the most thorough Danish example of how DIY urban design is employed as an investment and planning tool. It discusses the implications of DIY urbanism in terms of how it can be understood in the context of the struggles over ‘the right to the city’, how it applies different activist tactics for the appropriation of space, and how it is integrated in planning and the development logic. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Urban development and pedestrian thermal comfort in Melbourne

T2  - Solar Energy
AB  - In October 2013, “Plan Melbourne” was released by the Victorian government to outline the vision for Melbourne's growth to the year 2050. The City of Melbourne's draft municipal strategic statement identified “City North” as a great urban renewal area that can accommodate a significant part of the growth. Structure plans provide guidance to the community, planners, business, government and developers about the appropriate directions and opportunities for future changes in City North. Proposing street hierarchy, increasing the building heights, expanding the urban forest by increasing tree canopy coverage, implementing green roofs and overall transition from a low-rise to medium rise urban area are some of the strategies presented in structural plans. This study investigates the effect of future structural plans presented in “Plan Melbourne” on pedestrian thermal comfort in City North for extreme hot summer days. A three-dimensional microclimatic modelling tool ENVI-met 3.1 was used to evaluate the outdoor human thermal environment for the existing and future scenarios proposed by the Victorian government. Field measurements were carried out to validate ENVI-met and examine its ability in addressing the research objectives. Structural plans were modelled t in three stages; increased building height, adding tree canopy coverage and adding green roofs. The study showed that deeper canyons, higher aspect ratios and lower sky view factors in future scenario contribute to lower level of mean radiant temperatures (42 °C–64 °C), compared to the existing scenario (49 °C–60 °C). Physiological equivalent temperature (PET) was improved by 1 °C–4 °C as a result of “Increased building height” scenario. Increasing the tree canopy coverage caused 1 °C–2 °C reduction on PET level and adding a green roof did not show any improvement on PET at pedestrian level. Although the study showed a slight improvement in PET after implementing future structural plans, it was necessary to further improve PET level, particularly during certain hours of the day. Therefore long term planning strategies (integrating public realms with small urban parks and increasing the tree canopy coverage from 40% to 50%) were proposed and modelled to examine their effectiveness in further improving thermal comfort in an extremely hot summer day. Implementing future structural plans and proposed scenarios together resulted in 5.1 °C improvement in the PET in an extremely hot summer day. The study also indicated that aspect ratio (H/W) is the most efficient strategy in decreasing Tmrt and PET during the day. Integrating climatic knowledge into planning practices in Melbourne metropolitan area would lead to less vulnerability to the extreme heat events and reduce the adverse impacts of increased air temperature on public health. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AU  - Spataro, D.
T2  - Journal of Urbanism
AB  - Cultivated by non-professionals, do-it-yourself (DIY) interventions in urban space are gaining serious credibility in the professional design fields. But as these professionals take up the flag of small-scale and social justice-inspired action in design handbooks and art exhibits, what happens to the struggles that informed the tactics? This article presents the DIY urban tactics of Food Not Bombs as a counter case study that problematizes the recent professional attention given to DIY, tactical or spontaneous urbanism. Forged in a struggle against the structural violence of capitalism, and based in the use of public space for community meals, Food Not Bombs challenges de-politicized notions of tactical or DIY urbanism. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Due to urbanization, the urban heat island (UHI) effect has become a modern endemic threat to human health and energy consumption, especially in compact urban areas with high population density. Pocket parks, as the major component of urban green space in high-rise high-density built area of Hong Kong, play important roles in shaping the city. By conducting in situ climate measurements and morphological analysis of 12 sites in Hong Kong, this study investigates the impact of pocket parks on UHI intensity, and the relationships between five urban planning indicators and UHI. Results show that pocket parks and their surrounding areas in Hong Kong have a moderate UHI intensity (0.1 °C) during the daytime but a very high nighttime UHI intensity (2.39 °C). Ten parks are cooler than their surrounding urban streets for both daytime and nighttime, which means that pocket parks in Hong Kong can help to alleviate UHI intensity at the micro scale. Floor Area Ratio (FAR), building density and Tree Cover Ratio (TCR) are found to be significantly and negatively related with daytime UHI. It indicates that higher FAR, building density and TCR in high-rise high-density urban environment may help to reduce daytime UHI intensity without increasing the early nighttime intensity. Planting trees is an effective measure to reduce the UHI intensity inside the parks for high-rise high-density urban environment. But a threshold for TCR (around 42%) shall be achieved to maximize its cooling effect. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Negotiating space and visibility: Forms of informality in public space
AU  - Kamalipour, H.

AB  - Street trading has become integral to how public space works in cities of the global South. It cannot be considered as marginal since it gears to the urban economy and works as a key mode of income generation for the urban poor to sustain livelihoods. A poor understanding of how forms of street trading work in public space can lead to poor design and policy interventions. While many practices of formalization aim at the elimination of informality, the challenge is to explore the complex informal/formal relations and the dynamics of street trading to understand how forms of informality negotiate space and visibility in the public realm. In this paper, we propose a typology of street trading, based on the criteria of mobility within public space and proximity to public/private urban interfaces. While exploring the degrees of mobility in informal street trading can be crucial to the modes of governance and adaptability involved, of critical importance is to investigate how street trading takes place in relation to the built form-particularly the edges of public space where public/private interfaces enable or constrain exchange and appropriation. The developed typology provides a better understanding of the dynamics of street trading and contributes to the ways in which the built environment professions can most effectively engage with interventions in public space without eradicating the scope for informal adaptations. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Recent scholarship in critical urban theory, urban political ecology, and related fields has emphasized the “hybridity” of urban–environmental systems. This argument is contrasted with the socially constructed “binary” relationship between “city” and “nature” that dominated historical understandings of urban–environmental connections. Despite wide agreement on these issues, the trajectories that precipitated this shift in city–nature boundaries have been understudied. Many explanations position accelerating urbanization or changes in global political economy as driving the decline of the city–nature binary. This paper proposes that this transformation is also a product of the changing cultural and spatial dynamics of “race” between the 19th-century and the present. Drawing on research on urban parks in Chicago, I consider the production of park space at four important historical moments: (1) the mid-to-late 19th-century, when large picturesque parks were built; (2) the early 20th-century, when reform-oriented “small parks” were constructed; (3) the post-World War II period, which was marked by the development of recreation facilities; and (4) the contemporary period, where linear parks like Chicago’s 606 (which I term “imbricated spaces”) bring together built and natural environments in new ways. Through this analysis, I argue that the social construction of “city” and “nature,” as spatialized through urban park development, was co-produced with racialized spaces and symbols and contributed to the creation of metropolitan racial boundaries. Further, I argue that historical shifts in these racialized spaces and symbols have been implicated in the weakening of the city–nature binary and the rise of the hybrid city–nature relationship. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The formation of a marketing system often reflects historical legacies that seek to protect and preserve longstanding community interests. These legacies encourage some patterns of adaptive growth, but they may also limit other avenues of productive change. In this essay, we focus on the United States housing system as an illustration of a marketing system with significant legacy structures. Historically, this marketplace system arose to provide safe shelter for citizens and was enacted through building codes. These codes arose for historically important reasons, many of which are still pertinent today. Other legacies, however, inhibit market innovations, such as the significant barriers that exist for developing affordable housing. We argue that change in legacy market systems may require tactical moments of creative destruction. We examine a multi-stakeholder approach across the macro, meso, and micro levels of the marketplace to enable novel solutions for systemic change. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) is the most visited National Park in the United States and has the highest levels of biodiversity of any park unit. It is a relatively small park (∼210,433 ha), but topographically complex, with an elevational range of 1757 m. The Park has historically been subject to elevated levels of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Ozone trends are analyzed from 1989 to 2016 for six monitoring sites in and adjacent to GRSM and ranging in elevation from 564 m to 2030 m. Low-elevation sites have minimum O3 concentrations in early morning and maximum concentrations in mid-to late afternoon. High-elevation sites have flatter profiles, smaller diurnal ranges, and maxima that occur in early evening or at night. The W12624-h exposure index increases with elevation up to 823 m, after which it plateaus. W12624- h exposures increased between the years 1989–∼2002, and have substantially decreased afterwards. The highest 1-h concentration ever recorded in the Park was 135 ppb, which occurred on 25 August 1998. At most sites the maximum 3-month W12624-h exposures have shifted from mid-summer to spring (Apr–Jun). Decreases in exposure result primarily from reduction of hourly averaged O3 concentrations ≥ 60 ppb. Ozone episodes (3 or more consecutive hours when O3 ≥ 60 ppb) have decreased in frequency, magnitude, and duration from 1999 to 2016. Decreases in W126 exposures are correlated with lowered NOx emissions from regional TVA power plants and appear to be a direct result of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) call associated with the Clean Air Act Amendments, resulting in the cleanest air in GRSM over the period of record. Lower cumulative W126 O3 exposures and reduction in high O3 concentrations appear to be having beneficial effects on the vegetation within the Park. © 2019 The Author(s)

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - The capacity of small urban park to serve as urban habitats are rarely explored. This study analyses the characteristics of small urban parks and their potential to support urban biodiversity and ecological functions. Nine small urban parks were studied in Malaysia in August and September 2014 using the combined field survey method of structured observation and field measurements. The measured variables were divided into three broad categories of physical characteristics, species richness and human factors. Bird species richness and abundance were used as the indicators for assessing biodiversity. Pearson correlations and multiple regressions were conducted to analyse the relationships between variables and to identify which variables had a significant effect on bird species richness and abundance. The results demonstrated that park area and vegetation variables (e.g. the percentage of tree canopy cover, open grass/ground, native-exotic plants) are the important predictors of bird species richness and abundance. The percentage of canopy covers (negative relation) and park area (positive relation) are the best predictors of bird species richness in small urban parks. Meanwhile, the best predictors for bird abundance are the percentage of canopy covers (negative relation) and native vegetation species (positive relation). Human activities and park surroundings have a marginal effect on the presence of bird species in small parks. Based on the findings, we provide two general recommendations that could probably increase bird diversity in small urban parks: (1) the park development and management plan should incorporate a social-ecological approach that can benefit both city-dwellers and bird species, and (2) findings from the study should be used to rethink the planting design and composition of especially newly established small urban parks. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Cognitive functioning and academic performance of pupils depend on regular breaks from classroom work. However, it is unclear which settings during such breaks provide the best environment to restore cognitive performance and promote wellbeing of adolescent pupils. Therefore, we investigated the effects of staying in different urban green spaces during breaks. Sixty-four pupils (16–18 years old) participated in a cross-over experiment. They were placed into one of three settings (small park, larger park, forest) for one hour during a lunch break. Wellbeing was assessed four times (Nitsch scale), and a cognitive test (d2-R Test of Attention) was applied in the classrooms before and after the break. Wellbeing was almost always highest after the stay in the green spaces. However, a sustained effect was only found for the forest. Concentration performance values of the d2-R test were significantly higher after the pupils’ stay in green spaces for all sites. The highest increase of performance was found for the larger park type. In conclusion, this pilot study showed that study breaks in green spaces improved wellbeing and cognitive performance of adolescents. It also found that larger green spaces, either parks or forests, have stronger positive impacts on wellbeing and cognitive performance than small parks. © 2018 by the authors.

T2  - Forests
AB  - This paper examines the accessibility of urban green spaces within the Syrian city of Aleppo before the civil war using an environmental justice approach by indicating the current state of the parameters proximity and quantity in relation to the socioeconomic status of the inhabitants. Therefore, we conducted the average nearest neighbour analysis, facilities over and under coverage analysis, network analysis and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by a post-hoc Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test. The findings clearly indicate that the spatial pattern of the distribution of public parks facilities was significantly clustered (p-value < 0.0001), with a Z-score of -16.4. Several neighbourhoods within the western and central parts of the city were identified to have a higher density of facilities, while the majority of the neighbourhoods located in the marginal parts in eastern Aleppo (low income) lack access to urban green spaces. The hierarchy-wise analysis reveals a strong deficit of urban green spaces at lower hierarchies, for example pocket parks and neighbourhood parks, while access to quarter parks and district parks is high. The urban green spaces at higher hierarchies are located in high and middle socioeconomic status areas. Regarding social segregation in park distribution and their accessibility, the data showed that high income neighbourhoods enjoy a significantly higher percentage of park facilities. The approach presented in this paper offers a generic method for the future development of public green spaces for balanced and sustainable planning. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Trees offer a range of ecosystem services and remain important in providing human benefits. However, emerging literature questions the long-accepted view of trees being able to improve air quality in urban parks. The aerodynamic effect of trees was identified as a major reason for the change of pollutant distribution in near-road parks, where trees can act as porous barriers and cause localised concentration increase. Although not yet fully developed, planting strategies aiming to mitigate the negative effect of vegetation on air quality should be encouraged in future park design. In this study, we explored the effect of tree planting design on pollutant diffusion by integrating field surveys in urban parks in Hong Kong with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling. A series of indicators associated with tree morphology and landscape were derived from the surveys and their influence on air pollutant distribution in parks was examined using ENVI-MET. Dense trees with low crown base were found effective in improving air quality within parks when planted as barriers with a width of ~15 m at borders. However, more extensive planting led to a decrease in wind velocity and an increase in pollutant concentrations, which should be avoided. Tall trees tended to have little influence on airflow at the pedestrian level, which means they seem appropriate for small urban parks where wide barriers are not applicable and rapid ventilation should be encouraged. The tree distribution also altered the airflow and pollutant dispersion in parks. Our study provides clues for thoughtful planting strategies which can optimise air quality in urban parks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Urban parks play a key role in recreational activities, public health, and ecosystem services in urban areas. Using GIS and Fragstats, this study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban parks in Xi'an, China from 1949 to 2015 and the corresponding driving forces. The results show that the number and area of parks in Xi'an increased constantly during this period, especially from 2000 to 2015. Up to 2015, small green spaces, usually adjacent to streets, occupied the largest proportion among all types of parks. Archaeological parks were the largest in total area, but wetland parks were leading in average size of a single park. The density of parks was negatively correlated with their distance to the Clock Tower at the center of Xi'an. The dynamics of urban parks in highly urbanized areas were significantly different from that of their counterparts in suburban areas. Driving forces such as urban planning, urbanization and green space policies, and milestone events in the city's development jointly had a great effect on the distribution of parks in Xi'an. The research outcomes will support the upcoming Green Space Planning of Xi'an and benefit the pursuit of sustainability and human wellbeing.

TI  - Role of vegetation in deposition and dispersion of air pollution in urban parks
AU  - Xing, Y.
AU  - Brimblecombe, P.
T2  - Atmospheric Environment
AB  - Urban parks have long been considered places of refuge from the bustle, noise and pollutants of the surrounding city. Parks were labelled the lungs of the city, a metaphor which gained support as studies revealed the deposition of pollutants to leaf surfaces. More recently air purification by urban vegetation came to be seen as an ecosystem service, that add to the other important services it provides. However, the significance of deposition to foliage in reducing air pollutant concentrations in cities and the service this provides is often questioned. Although pollutants deposit on vegetation, the change in turbulence and wind speed brought about by increased friction can often limit dispersion and means that pollutant concentrations can be higher than expected. This paper re-analyses pollutant transects away from roads and into parks to compare the relevance of deposition and dispersion to lowered concentrations in park interiors and shows that pollutant concentrations typically decline more rapidly along transects with vegetation than those without. This may support the notion that deposition to vegetation rapidly reduces pollutant concentrations, but simulations using ENVI-MET reveal that even dense foliage offers little improvement to air quality via removal of pollutants in small urban parks with length scale less than 100 m. New field observations show the dominance of aerodynamic factors in changing air quality in urban parks and the way vegetation affects pollutant concentrations through altering air flows. Deposition is generally not important for parks although it plays a role in the rapid removal of large particles with rapid settling velocities (>10 cm s−1) at the park borders (<5 m). Across cities as a whole rarely more than a percent or so of individual pollutants are removed by urban vegetation. Deposition on foliage is not an important contribution to improved air quality. Vegetation can alter the dispersion of pollutants from roads into parks and effectively increase pollutant concentrations. Nevertheless stands of trees or flower beds can affect the distribution of park users, so may change exposure to air pollutants by altering the spatial distribution of occupants. © 2018

AU  - Zhu, Z.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - Following decades of debate, there is a growing consensus that environmental justice is an important value that should be pursued in green infrastructure (GI) provision, though there is a limited understanding of the precise ways by which to measure and respond to environmental justice needs. By developing a GI Equity Index that has been adjusted to reflect the local situation in Haizhu District in Guangzhou, this research examines environmental justice problems in respect to the provision of GI and proposes an amendment to the future GI plan. The integrated equity index map provides a comprehensive picture of the urgency of GI provision: Communities with the highest 20% equity index value are concentrated in the central part of Haizhu, which is a combination of an old city and villages. These areas are also where most of the urban waterlogging points are situated, and the loss would thus be greater. Unfortunately, these areas have been ignored by the Sponge City Plan of Guangzhou (2016–2030). This has led to a proposal in this research to adjust the GI plan: Additional green amenities should be provided in neighbourhoods with high GI equity index values. Such amenities could include small parks and playgrounds in densely developed central cities, or the replacement of impervious surfaces with permeable surfaces, etc. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Tactical urbanism as a means of testing relational processes in space: A complex systems perspective
AU  - Wohl, S.
T2  - Planning Theory
AB  - Too often, master planning strategies have failed to produce spaces responding to the social, cultural, and economic needs of their inhabitants. Accordingly, many planners have turned to relational strategies to redefine their practices. These tend toward methodologies that explore relational forces preceding design interventions rather than unfolding by means of design interventions. This article considers an alternative mode of understanding relational processes: one that considers tactical urban strategies theorized through the lens of complexity theory. This article argues that tactical approaches harness relational junctures in situ, effectively exploring relational configurations of cohesive urban environments. A design competition entry provides an illustrative example of this approach: one that channels and choreographs relational urban processes. © The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - Livable city: An approach to pedestrianization through tactical urbanism
AU  - Yassin, H.H.
T2  - Alexandria Engineering Journal
AB  - Many ancient cities around the world were known with their livability. However, these cities started to lose this feature, when vehicles became prior to pedestrians who lost their sense of place, as many negative impacts came along. In return, people escaped the city's core searching for lively districts with attractive streets where the human basic activities can be performed. As a result, dead city centers were left behind. The present paper work proposes an integrative literature between the pedestrianization and livability, then analyze the precedent approaches to pedestrianization in global review, and introduce a creative implementation approach to pedestrianization in order to achieve the following objectives: (1) a tool to break the various barriers that may face implementation, (2) a method of exploration regarding the potential of the misused asphalt, (3) a tactic to re-attract people to the city's core and its walkable environment and finally, (4) restore the city's livability thus its sustainable urban development. From this perspective, by rejuvenating the core of a city, the entire city's livability could be restored, causing a sustainable urban development, through the creative tactical urbanism. Also, the paper includes an analysis of international examples, based on the criterion of tactical urbanism practices. © 2019 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University

TI  - Sustainable development for recovering economic crisis: A possible solution for Brazil
AU  - Campelo, A.

T2  - WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment
AB  - Brazil has been going through a period of intense political turmoil. The impeachment process of former president Dilma Rousseff started in December 2015 and brought significant upheaval to a country that now faces a deep political crisis. Accused of abuse of power, Mrs. Rousseff was charged with criminal administrative misconduct and violation of the federal budget, and in August 2016 was removed from office and replaced by Vice President Michel Temer. The new administration, in conjunction with the National Congress, lost no time in implementing new law reform programs, a questionable tactic designed to dodge lawsuits. To control expenses, Constitutional Amendments such as PEC 241 propose the freezing of public expenditures in health care and education for the next 20 years, potentially harming the development of the country and well-being of the citizens. It is precisely at this moment that Brazilian Urban Policies come into context and one must ask if the current policies are designed to benefit the government and its leaders or the people of Brazil. From this point of view, this paper aims to discuss how public policies that once generated social and economic development have been affected by the presidential impeachment process and how this can become a moment of opportunity to pursue a sustainable development capable of reviving Brazil’s economy. Through a social, environmental and economic approach, it is possible to develop a resilient economy capable of surviving, adapting and flourishing in the face of turbulent events. Designing cities that meet future needs, while improving human quality of life over time, is a clever way to develop the country, create meaningful jobs, restore the confidence of people in their institutions and assure the existence of natural resources for future generations. This article is intended to examine the current situation of Brazil’s urban policies and to propose feasible solutions within the country’s current context, which will benefit the entire population and improve overall quality of life. © 2017 WIT Press.

AB  - Decades of research support the idea that striving for lower sound levels is the cornerstone of protecting urban public health. Growing insight on urban soundscapes, however, highlights a more complex role of sound in public spaces, mediated by context, and the potential of soundscape interventions to contribute to the urban experience. We discuss Musikiosk, an unsupervised installation allowing users to play audio content from their own devices over publicly provided speakers. Deployed in the gazebo of a pocket park in Montreal (Parc du Portugal), in the summer of 2015, its effects over the quality of the public urban experience of park users were researched using a mixed methods approach, combining questionnaires, interviews, behavioral observations, and acoustic monitoring, as well as public outreach activities. An integrated analysis of results revealed positive outcomes both at the individual level (in terms of soundscape evaluations and mood benefits) and at the social level (in terms of increased interaction and lingering behaviors). The park was perceived as more pleasant and convivial for both users and non-users, and the perceived soundscape calmness and appropriateness were not affected. Musikiosk animated an underused section of the park without displacing existing users while promoting increased interaction and sharing, particularly of music. It also led to a strategy for interacting with both residents and city decision-makers on matters related to urban sound. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Current global enthusiasm for urban greening and bringing nature back into cities is unprecedented. Evidence of the socioecological benefits of large, permanent greenspaces is mounting, but the collective potential for pop-up parks (PUPs) – small, temporary greenspaces – to augment urban ecosystem services is unknown. To showcase the potential of PUPs, we first highlight a case study demonstrating how PUPs may enhance biodiversity in a densely urbanized area; we then review evidence linking the design of small greenspaces with positive social outcomes, including benefits to human well-being. Finally, we emphasize how PUPs can function as socioecological laboratories to help inform urban design, and then propose a research agenda to better understand how PUPs may be optimally designed to provide benefits to humans and other species. © The Ecological Society of America

Little is known about the role of university-community partnerships involved in tactical urbanism as a method to revitalize low resource communities of color. This paper describes the planning process in a partnership between Florida State University and its surrounding community. We highlight the role of faculty and students in facilitating a studio project in Frenchtown implementing tactical urbanism. It also provides the voices of residents, City officials, and non-profit organizations. We conclude with recommendations to improve university-community partnerships through long-term engagement in surrounding communities. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Publicly owned lands designated as parks can be important tools for biodiversity conservation. In the U.S., state parks are afforded direct protection from localized development pressures, which may help to protect small, ecologically significant ecosystems such as isolated and ephemeral wetlands and headwater streams. We used the South Carolina State Park system as a case study to examine the structural and functional differences between small wetlands located inside vs. outside of parks in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge ecoregions in order to evaluate the efficacy of a small-scale conservation framework for protecting small, under-protected freshwater ecosystems. We evaluated data relating to water quality, wetland structure, and biodiversity parameters collected between January 2010 and June 2011. Our results indicated marked differences between park and non-park wetlands, with park wetlands having shallower depths, higher abundances of sensitive benthic macroinvertebrate taxa, and lower average tolerance values consistent with more sensitive macroinvertebrate species and higher water quality. These findings demonstrate that state parks can serve to protect freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity. State parks, thus, represent a preexisting network of protected areas to aid in the protection of localized habitats, such as small isolated and ephemeral wetlands, that may not otherwise receive the conservation protection warranted by their ecological function. © 2018 Natural Areas Association.

TI  - Bird fauna changes in a small urban park in South Sweden, over a period of 34 years
AU  - Ottosson, U.

T2  - Ornis Svecica
AB  - The density of birds in urban landscapes, including parks, is poorly known. In this study we present surveys of a small city park in south Sweden. The surveys were conducted in April–June 1980 and in May–June 2014. The study plot has an area of 5.1 ha. We found 143 pairs of 22 species in 1980 and 151 pairs of 26 species in 2014 (2800 and 2960 pairs/km2). Turdus pilaris was the most common species in 1980 and Columba palumbus in 2014. Three species showed signiicant decline: T. pilaris 38 to 15 pairs, Fringilla coelebs 12 to 5 pairs and Carduelis chloris 18 to 12 pairs, while Turdus merula increased from 11 to 15 pairs. Two species, T. merula and Sylvia atricapilla, nesting both 1980 and 2014, showed increasing numbers that are consistent with these species’ population increase in Sweden. The bird densities in this study are considerably higher compared to what is generally observed in southern Sweden. Further study is required to establish whether the high densities are due to chance or edge effect. © 2016. University of Lund. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid increase in population and the enlarged accumulation of buildings in Egypt, green areas shrunk, to reduce the share per person much less than in developed countries which led to appearance of several environmental and social complications. In view of the current existing design of the small spaces between residential units, they suffer from poor design and high cost, making them less popular. The research purposes to achieve sustainability in designing spaces between residential units (vest -pocket parks) and to recognize remarkable local and international experiences to comprehend and discover the advantages and disadvantages, as well as comparing the cost of construction with traditional materials and methods and the use of some methods that decrease the cost in the long term and achieve sustainability. The research furthermore seeks the participation of users and the Designers throughout constructing and implementing a questionnaire. The research ends with the selection of an open space between residential units (Zahraa Al Helmiya City- Helmiya El Zatoon-Cairo) as a case study to acquire a sustainable design as an effective tool in sustainable urban design. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

TI  - Excluded by design: informality versus tactical urbanism in the redevelopment of Detroit neighborhoods
AU  - Berglund, L.
T2  - Journal of Cultural Geography
AB  - Over the last half century, Detroit has been defined by economic collapse and worsening social stratification. Street vending, murals, and urban agriculture have served as means for disenfranchised communities to resist exclusion from and discrimination by the formal systems that provide services and amenities to their wealthier counterparts. In recent years, “tactical urbanism” has been promoted by urban designers appropriating informal practices as spurs to redevelopment. This paper analyzes media coverage of the simultaneous use of street vending, murals, and urban agriculture by private investors in Detroit's redeveloping neighborhoods, and their informal adoption by marginalized Detroiters, and reveals how the appropriation of informal practices by developers and new arrivals to the city has become commonplace in reinvested areas, but is treated fundamentally differently than informal practices of long-standing residents. My analysis points to inconsistencies in the ways that informal activities, often condemned as illegal when practiced by long-standing residents, are accepted as entrepreneurial by the media and presented as necessary to attract an arriving class of young professionals. I consider how new, more affluent arrivals to the city participate in the “renaissance” of Detroit by manipulating legal frameworks that define the realms of informality and criminality. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AU  - Bugarič, B.
T2  - Urbani Izziv
AB  - Urban acupuncture actions are small-scale, bottom-up projects that foster community building. The approach provides an alternative to investor urbanism and motivates residents of neglected neighbourhoods to engage in place-making. The playground in Ljubljana's suburb of Zalog is a perfect example of an intervention that converted a neglected site into a main meeting point of the neighbourhood. The needs of youngsters were inquired about and considered; they became active partners in the transformation of public space. Urban acupuncture is a valuable tool for place-making in locations where market forces overshadow the residents' ability to make decisions about their own right to the city. © 2018 Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia.

TI  - Do small green roofs have the possibility to offer recreational and experiential benefits in a dense urban area? A case study in Helsinki, Finland
AU  - Mesimäki, M.
AU  - Hauru, K.
AU  - Lehvävirta, S.
T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - Growing and densifying cities set challenges for preserving and enhancing sufficient and good quality green urban environment. Rooftops offer vacant room for additional urban greening that may contribute to the well-being of people and the liveability of cities, but this potential lacks empirical support. In spite of the fact that even small green spaces produce, for example restorative experiences, the literature concerning the experiential and recreational benefits of green roofs is still scarce. To identify the experiential potential of a small urban green roof we explored restorative and other experiences of 178 people visiting a sparsely vegetated green roof in the centre of Helsinki, Finland, using a questionnaire. We showed that the studied green roof provided restorative and other positive experiences to the visitors. The level of perceived restorativeness was relatively high. In addition, the results revealed multiple perceived qualities that reflected visual as well as other sensory experiences, beauty, suitability of the place for oneself and the urban context, nature, desire to explore the place and interestedness, positive excitement, and safety. Furthermore, answers to the open questions revealed a wide range of other observations and feelings, such as peace, joy, excitement and hope. Our study indicates that even a small and rather ascetic accessible green roof has potential to offer a moment of respite in the middle of urban everyday hassle, thus implying that these kinds of solutions may allow for a pinch of beneficial green in places where more diverse and lusher solutions are not possible due to, e.g. the load capacity of a roof. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Interrogating rainwater harvesting as Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Urbanism
AU  - Elder, A.D.
AU  - Gerlak, A.K.
T2  - Geoforum
AB  - For the first time in history, the global population is more concentrated in urban spaces than in rural areas. Population growth, climate change, and increasing stress on water resources evidence the urgency of adopting more sustainable urban water management practices. Drawing on contributions from the literature on informality, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Urbanism, and urban rainwater harvesting, we investigate DIY Urbanism as a specific type of informality and as a strategy for citizen action to push local governments to adopt and institutionalize water sustainability initiatives. Taking the city of Tucson, Arizona, a pioneer of arid urban rainwater harvesting practices, as a case study, we examine rainwater harvesting as a proposed sustainable urban water management practice for a water-stressed city with aging infrastructure and a growing population particularly vulnerable to a changing climate. Based on interviews, stakeholder meetings, and document analysis, this paper examines several elements of the rainwater harvesting movement in Tucson that both mesh with and differ from other types of informality. We find that although rainwater harvesting contributes to the vision of an urban utopia for some local activists and NGO actors, for those working within the municipal bureaucracy, it may be viewed as an attack on social order and private resource rights. Despite some loss of autonomy in implementing DIY Urbanism after its institutionalization and emerging maintenance issues, DIY Urbanists in Tucson continue to challenge official authority to remake the city. We caution that the subsequent institutionalization of urban rainwater harvesting should not further institutionalize inequities in access but rather promote greater water democracy in cities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Starting from a previous experience carried out by the working group “Building and Environmental Hygiene” of the Italian Society of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine (SItI), the aim of the present work is to define new strategic goals for achieving a “Healthy and Salutogenic City”, which will be useful to designers, local governments and public bodies, policy makers, and all professionals working at local health agencies. Ten key points have been formulated: 1. climate change and management of adverse weather events; 2. land consumption, sprawl, and shrinking cities; 3. tactical urbanism and urban resilience; 4. urban comfort, safety, and security perception; 5. strengths and weaknesses of urban green areas and infrastructures; 6. urban solid waste management; 7. housing emergencies in relation to socio-economic and environmental changes; 8. energy aspects and environmental planning at an urban scale; 9. socio-assistance and welfare network at an urban scale: importance of a rational and widespread system; and 10. new forms of living, conscious of coparticipation models and aware of sharing quality objectives. Design strategies, actions, and policies, identified to improve public health and wellbeing, underline that the connection between morphological and functional features of urban context and public health is crucial for contemporary cities and modern societies. © 2018 by the authors.

T2  - CoDesign
AB  - This article examines the role that nonhumans play in participatory design. Research and practice concerned with participatory design mostly focuses on human participants, however nonhumans also participate in the design process and can play a significant role in shaping the process. This article focuses on how nonhumans participate in the design process. An empirical case study is used to illustrate how humans and nonhumans assemble to form networks in order to effect a design. Nonhumans increase the level of participation in a design process. The case study reveals how nonhumans help to maintain, destroy or strengthen networks by substituting, mediating and communicating with humans and often, in doing so, making human actors more or less visible in the process.

TI  - The transformative (and potentially discriminatory) possibilities of animating public space
AU  - Glover, T.D.
T2  - World Leisure Journal
AB  - Despite their proliferation across the globe, efforts to animate public space remain largely unexamined in the leisure literature. Animating public space refers to “the deliberate, usually temporary, employment of festivals, events, programmed activities, or pop-up leisure to transform, enliven, and/or alter public spaces and stage urban life.” This article examines the practice of animating public space as a form of transformative placemaking that enables urban inhabitants to assert their “right to the city”, while considering how such practices reproduce power relations to create (unintentionally or intentionally) discriminatory outcomes. In so doing, the article explores the complex nature of animation efforts and tensions that exist in animated public spaces that, on the surface, appear inclusive. Its conclusions provide direction for future research on the topic by identifying questions that warrant attention. © 2018, © 2018 World Leisure Organization.

TI  - Postsocialist informal urbanism between creativity and power. Notes on four projects from Romania
AU  - Vǎetişi, Ş.
T2  - Sudosteuropa
AB  - The author illustrates squatting, do-it-yourself urbanism, creative re-appropriation of public space, guerrilla gardening, and artistic occupy-type intervention as forms and evolutions of informal urbanism. By interpreting examples observed in two postsocialist Romanian cities the author comments on the thin boundary between informal and authorized urbanism, and between creativity and power; he interrogates also the key matter of access to the city, with its regulations, resources, and potentialities. His perspective implies an empirical and ethnographic approach to informality, which is analysed in the contexts of privatization logics, especially in relation to the reconfiguration of the public and the private which is so specific to postsocialist transformations. The contrast between grass-roots responses and official projects is seen as decisive in understanding strategies of representations, control of resources, and capital accumulation. Additionally the author suggests the relevance of theorizing such postsocialist urban processes in fruitful but critical comparison with other non-Western forms of urbanism, notably postcolonial ones. © 2018 Sudosteuropa.

TI  - Aroma-Home's edible stories: An urban community garden performs
AU  - Haedicke, S.
T2  - Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems
AB  - Aroma-Home, an artist-initiated community garden in Villetaneuse, just outside Paris, France, originated as a way to poeticize damaged urban locations by creating small communally-created pockets of unexpected natural beauty. In 2013, Sarah Harper of Friches Théâtre Urbain joined forces with local inhabitants to reclaim public spaces marred by construction and neglect. Together, they began to alter the urban landscape with whimsical plant-based interventions that sprouted up behind construction fences. This guerrilla gardening soon led to the sowing of a community garden that wove together food-growing, story-telling and place-making and fashioned its particular identity through cultural practices around growing, preparing and sharing food of the multi-ethnic participants. The horticultural-culinary conversations became inextricably connected to gardening activities: edible stories involving food memories and horticultural skills that nourished those who prepared and consumed them. This 'From the Field' paper looks at how the community garden/art-making processes of Aroma-Home transformed a bleak construction site into a mini-urban agricultural 'commons' where imagining, planting and harvesting the garden and its edible stories were all shared. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.

AU  - Sarmiento, C.S.

T2  - Journal of Urbanism
AB  - Micro-urban interventions at the smallest scales represent a challenge for planners concerned with social justice and urban theory. This paper seeks to contribute to the understanding of micro-urbanism through an exploration of the Little Free Library phenomenon. Two case studies in Madison, Wisconsin and Santa Ana, California provide data for a combined quantitative and qualitative analysis that together support a complicated view of the phenomenon and offer insights into urban theory. In particular, the article proposes that Little Free Libraries represent micro-urbanist actions, which can be analyzed according to a theoretical terrain that often blurs the boundaries between “do-it-yourself,” tactical, and guerrilla urbanism. Our research supports the view that micro-urban interventions can take on different forms as either a grassroots contribution to resolving urban problems or a bottom-up effort reinforcing existing and developing spatial inequities. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - There are few studies examining the wellbeing benefits from exposure to natural environments differing in ecological attributes, such as biodiversity, and they have not had consistent results. This study progresses our understanding of the nuanced relationship between nature and wellbeing by analyzing the self-reported benefits derived from urban green spaces varying in a range of objectively measured biodiversity attributes such as bird species richness, habitat diversity, and structural heterogeneity. Respondents' (n = 840) perceptions of biodiversity and naturalness were also examined. We identified the biodiversity attributes most strongly associated with particular benefits, as well as the types of parks where those benefits were significantly more likely to occur. Findings suggest that perceived, rather than objective measures of biodiversity are better predictors of subjective wellbeing benefits. Of the assessed biodiversity attributes, vegetation cover consistently correlated most strongly with psychological benefits. Stress reduction and mood improvement were greatest in nature parks and lowest in pocket parks. Increases in each biodiversity attribute significantly affected psychological wellbeing at different thresholds, suggesting the relationship between biodiversity and wellbeing is not linear. Thresholds of sensitivity for park attributes are discussed, with vegetation cover, naturalness, structural heterogeneity, and park type emerging as the most useful differentiators for studying human responses to nature. Our findings can help inform green space planning to maximize environmental benefits and health benefits concurrently. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - The infamous Pearl Harbor Radar
AU  - Hindle, P.
AU  - Mumford, R.

T2  - Microwave Journal
AB  - Radar and microwave technology have made revolutionary advances since the 1930s. Consider the Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX-1), developed to provide early warning of ballistic missiles. Part of the Missile Defense Agency's missile defense system, SBX-1 is a floating, self-propelled, AESA that uses 45,000 solid-state T/R modules (see Figure 7). Deployed in the Pacific Ocean, the SBX-1 is, ironically, serviced at Pearl Harbor. Compare this to the four vehicle, mobile SCR-270, operating at 106 MHz. Privates Lockard and Elliot stood guard over the SCR-270 radar for most of their 12 hour overnight shift, but they were able to operate the radar from 4:00 to 7:00 a.m., thought to be the most likely time the Japanese would attack. Just by chance, they kept the radar running two minutes longer and detected the Japanese planes that attacked Pearl Harbor on that infamous morning, December 7, 1941. The Opana Radar Site is now a National Historic Landmark and was designated an IEEE Historical Milestone in February 2000. A plaque noting the IEEE designation was installed in a small park on the grounds of the Turtle Bay Hilton at Kuilima Point. Probably unnoticed by most tourists staying at the resort, the plaque commemorates the first operational use of radar by the United States.

AB  - This research investigates the socio-spatial causes and consequences of tactical urbanism practices in Baghdad. It attempts to identify the main creators of these practices and their motivations. It recognizes five common practices of tactical urbanism in Baghdad, public art, pop-up rest areas, pavement plazas, guerrilla gardening, and open streets. This research argues that the applications of tactical urbanism in Baghdad could revive urban spaces and positively impact local communities, and that it could have various implications for urban policies. This article examines evidence from fieldwork and interviews with individuals involved in tactical urbanism projects. It also employs a questionnaire which addresses the opinions of individuals in the profession of architecture and urban design regarding the impact of tactical urbanism. © 2019, International University of Sarajevo.

AU  - Volont, L.
T2  - City and Community
AB  - A growing body of literature has been explicitly concerned with a range of microspatial practices that are currently reshaping urban spaces under the valuable denominator of “DIY urbanism.” However, there is still much work to be done if we are to take into consideration DIY urbanism's primary source and output: the commons. As such, Spanish DIY collectives have taken an explicit interest in building and reclaiming the urban commonwealth through participatory DIY interventionism. Therefore, this article assesses Spanish DIY urbanism through the lens of the commons and asks how the vocabulary of the latter might help us to further understand the DIY practice. In so doing, DIY urbanism will be put forward as “a field of possibilities” through three key features that inform commons theorizing: threshold spatiality, value, and legitimacy. © 2019 American Sociological Association

AB  - Temporary use as a subject of work should be understood as temporary development or use of land and facilities, in a way that allows the best use of spatial resources at a given time and place. The author takes up the topic of temporary use being an intentional element of strategy in the design and planning of space. Analysis of practical applications focuses on the depiction of models of design and planning processes, the element of which is the temporary use of space and overall transformation processes, as well as features and functions of temporary uses. The researched practices concern processes composed of various elements, eg mutual relations of temporary use with permanent development. The analysis of good practices indicates a significant strengthening of the potential for temporary use, if it is implemented through a network of broad connections and the integration of various activities and environments. © 2018 Karolina Marta Szaton published by Sciendo 2018.

T2  - Energies
AB  - Urban heat waves and the overall growing trend in the annual global temperature underline the importance of urban/architectural resilience and the need to reduce energy consumption. By designing urban voids, it is possible to create thermodynamic buffers, i.e., bubbles of controlled atmosphere that act as mediators between the natural and built environments, between the human body and the surrounding air, between meteorology and physiology (meteorological architecture). Multiple small actions in the urban fabric's open spaces, such as replacing dark pavements or inserting vegetation and green spaces, are intended to improve outdoor comfort conditions and therefore the resilience of the city itself. This not only benefits the place's quality, which is intrinsic to the new project, but also the insulating capacity of buildings, which are relieved of an external heat load. The design emphasis therefore changes from solid structures to the climate and weather conditions, which are invisible but perceivable. To design and control these constructed atmopheres, tomographic sections processed with computational fluid dynamics software (tomographic environmental section, TENS) becomes necessary. It allows the effects of an extreme event on an outdoor environment to be evaluated in order to establish the appropriate (adaptive) climate mitigation devices, especially in historical centers where energy retrofits are often discouraged. By fixing boundary conditions after a local intervention, the virtual environment can be simulated and then "sliced" to analyze initial values and verify the design improvements. © 2017 by the authors.

TI  - Blind spots and pop-up spots: A feminist exploration into the discourses of do-it-yourself (DIY) urbanism
AU  - Heim LaFrombois, M.
T2  - Urban Studies
AB  - This paper is a theoretical exploration of dominant conceptualisations of do-it-yourself urbanism, which draws from and contributes to feminist inquiries into urban planning and policies. Do-it-yourself urbanism is defined as unauthorised, grassroots, and citizen-led urban planning interventions that are small scale, functional, temporary, creative, and place specific; are focused on reclaiming and re-purposing urban spaces; and take place outside formal urban planning structures and systems. This paper questions and complicates the dominant discourses surrounding do-it-yourself urbanism by highlighting the racialised, classed, gendered, and sexualised ‘blind spots’ and biases found within conceptualisations of the topic, its activities, actors, and spaces. It also investigates how do-it-yourself urbanism activities and actors are connected to and embedded in larger urban systems and policies. I argue that the dominant discourses of do-it-yourself urbanism focus on a narrow set of urban planning interventions, which may have major implications for cities and their residents. However, the terrain of do-it-yourself urbanism is diverse, fluid, paradoxical, and at times subversive, revealing bright spots for more inclusive and reflexive practice. © 2015, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2015.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine street environments wherein fear of crime and actual crime are highest in the environments surrounding elementary schools. To achieve this objective, elementary students' fear of crime and actual crime experienced were analyzed. The study adopted a geographical method based on streets. The study results were as follows. First, a large number of elementary students experienced fear of crime on the road at the school they attended. Female students feared crime more than male students. Second, students' fear of crime was mainly attributed to human factors (Many Bullies, Few People). Third, most elementary students experienced a fear of crime within a certain distance (500 m) from the school. Fourth, fear of crime and actual crime occurred mainly in small streets, small parks, or middle or high schools (advanced schools) nearby. Fifth, fear of crime and actual crime occurred near geographically similar elementary schools. Sixth, elementary students primarily experienced a fear of crime and actual crime on streets in densely populated residential areas. © 2017, Architectural Institute of Japan. All rights Reserved.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - Urban green spaces have a beneficial effect on the health and well-being of citizens. The features of such spaces and users’ satisfaction with them determine the type and frequency of activities conducted inside parks. Understanding the relationships among these aspects is important for promoting adequate designs for these spaces. On the other hand, the limited availability of urban surface area in many cities determines the size of parks. The effect of size on people's satisfaction and their use of parks is an aspect that has not been studied in depth in the scientific literature. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the relationships between citizens’ perceptions of the parks’ features and their uses as a function of their size. For this purpose, surveys were conducted in large and small green spaces. The results showed the importance of considering noise in the management of both types of parks to improve overall satisfaction. In addition, overall satisfaction was related to visual aspects (conservation) in large parks, and social aspects (safety and users) in small parks. Suitably designed canine and play areas in large parks and functionality for the streets surrounding small parks can contribute to reducing noise annoyance. This study showed that the size of green spaces has a positive correlation with the frequency of walking, exercising and relaxing. Furthermore, improving some environmental features would also help to increase the frequency of these activities. In this regard, the existence of groves played an important role in promoting physical activity in both types of parks, and the quality of the air and the absence of noise contributed to relaxation in large parks. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

T2  - Landscape Research
AB  - Urban green spaces have been shown to promote health and well-being and recent research indicates that the two primary potentially health promoting uses of pocket parks are ‘rest and restitution’ and ‘socialising’. The aim of this study is to identify features in pocket parks that may support these uses. The relationship between the two types of use and the shape, size, noise level, greenness, as well as ‘elements’ (paved and unpaved trails, café, historical feature, table, other seating than benches, flowerbeds, view outside park, playground) in nine pocket parks in Copenhagen were analysed. The results show that ‘green features’ do not seem to be of crucial importance for ‘socialising’ whereas, as expected, features promoting gathering should be prioritised. For ‘rest and restitution’, the main results show that ‘green ground cover’ and ‘enclosed green niches’ are important, while ‘disturbing features’ (playground, view outside park) should be avoided. The results add knowledge about the features which support the health promoting use of pocket parks to the existing body of research. © 2014 Landscape Research Group Ltd.

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - Redistribution of space from private motorized vehicles to sustainable modes of transport is gaining popularity as an approach to alleviate transport problems in many cities around the world. This article investigates the impact of a trial Complete Streets project, in which road space is reallocated to bicyclists and pedestrians in Trondheim, Norway. The paper focuses on changes in the travel behavior of users of the street, with a focus on route and mode choice. In total, 719 people responded to a web-based travel survey, which also encompassed an integrated mapping Application Programming Interface (API). Amongst the findings of the survey is that the average length of the trial project that was utilized by cyclists on their most common journey through the neighborhood nearly doubled from 550 m to 929 m (p < 0.0005), suggesting that the intervention was highly attractive to bicyclists. Respondents were also asked whether they believe the trial project was positive for the local community, with the majority (87%) being positive or highly positive to the change. The intervention had a considerable impact on users' travel behavior in terms of both frequency and choice of active transportation modes, together with leading to a change in route preferences. © 2018 by the authors.

AU  - McGlone, N.
T2  - Australian Planner
AB  - With growing interest in temporary public space in Australia and internationally, this article examines the potential role of temporary public space in the lives of children. It considers whether the short-term, interactive nature of temporary public space supports or inhibits children's need for play and connection to community. The author examines the opinions of children aged 5–12 about a Melbourne based Pop-Up Park. The findings suggest that temporary public space provides children with a wide variety of socio-spatial offerings including opportunities for unstructured creative play, connection with community and relaxation. The author concludes with some thoughts about the potential role of temporary public space in the Child-Friendly Cities movement and children's participation in urban planning. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Temporary urbanism and urban sustainability after a natural disaster: transitional community-initiated open spaces in Christchurch, New Zealand
AU  - Wesener, A.
T2  - Journal of Urbanism
AB  - Temporary uses of vacant urban spaces are usually not foreseen in conventional urban planning and have often been linked to economic or political disturbances. In New Zealand, Christchurch’s vacant spaces came into existence after the city was hit by several devastating earthquakes in 2010 and 2011. Parallel to the ‘official’ rebuild discourse, temporary uses have emerged on vacant post-earthquake sites including community gardens, urban agriculture, art installations, event venues, eateries and cafés, and pocket parks. Based on the review and analysis of exemplary transitional community-initiated open spaces and correlated literature, the paper looks at how the post-disaster urban context in Christchurch has influenced particular aspects of temporary urbanism in comparison with case studies in non-disaster environments. By focusing on the anticipated benefits of community-initiated open spaces, the paper discusses the relevance of temporary uses of vacant urban spaces for urban sustainability in relationship to concepts of community resilience and raises questions about possible long-term values. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Revisiting the San Francisco parklets problematizing publicness, parks, and transferability
AU  - Littke, H.
T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - One day in 2005, a bench, some grass, and a tree suddenly appeared on a parking spot in central San Francisco. The parking meter was paid for two hours, and after that the installation disappeared. This action by the art-design-activist organization Rebar has led to the annual global event Park(ing) Day and an official planning program in San Francisco, From Pavements to Parks, inspiring cities around the world to introduce their own parklet projects.Many cities are facing challenges such as economic deficits and a lack of open public spaces, and growing concerns exist regarding the need for urban greenery. This paper discusses how parklets are challenging the role of public spaces and urban nature, drawing on discussions and conceptualizations of publicness, observational data, literature review, and document analysis to explore the influence of parklets as an urban design strategy at a local and global level.The symbolic change from parking space to public park space and the tactical urbanism inspiration of the concept constitute both parts of the symbolic value of parklets. At the same time, the line between community activism and urban strategy has been blurred. The city reviews, permits, and inspects the projects; and the sponsor is responsible for the design, financing, maintenance, and liability. The paper concludes that, even though parklets might provide a new public space and bring greenery to streetscapes, publicness, roles and responsibility, as well as the functionality of nature in these projects, remain crucial questions. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Tactical urbanism: Towards an evolutionary cities’ approach?
AU  - Silva, P.
T2  - Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design
AB  - Tactical urbanism initiatives have been interpreted as an alternative and a challenge to formal spatial planning tools to the need for a more responsive planning system. Short-term implementation, scarce resources and citizens’ involvement are said to be the key characteristics of this emerging movement in urbanism. In tactical urbanism, everything seems focussed on one thing: action. This paper analyses tactical urbanism initiatives in the United States considering three main aspects: the process, its interaction with planning institutions and the respective urban design outcomes. For this, the relation between tactical urbanism and complexity theory (in which self-organisation and evolution play an important role) is addressed. Findings suggest some contributions that tactical urbanism can make to urban design and spatial planning, in evolutionary terms and possible role for tactical urbanism in alternative to traditional division between plan making and plan implementation. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

TI  - Enabling bottom-up practices in urban and architectural design studios
AU  - Pak, B.
T2  - Knowledge Cultures
AB  - This paper discusses the emergent practices in the fields of architecture and urban design and reveals their relevance for the future of design learning. As a starting point it distills three forms of bottom-up practices where: ordinary people reclaim and make urban spaces through self-organized acts (Occupy Urbanism); short-term, affordable and scalable interventions aiming at enabling ordinary people to take part in the shaping of their environment (Tactical Urbanism); and initiatives combining the former two by establishing a hybrid coalition network (Hybrid Urbanism). This discussion reveals that a key characteristic of these practices is the employment of design tactics grounded in time. Among these tactics are temporality, openness, ad-hocism, looseness, biophilia and bottomup aesthetics. Reflecting on these tactics, it elaborates on how design studio education can be rethought to facilitate socially engaged forms of learning which are capable of challenging the status quo of individualistic design. It suggests Participatory Action Research (PAR) as a potential systematic framework for enabling bottom-up social knowledge building through design actions and reflections between the students, potential users and the socio-spatial context. Furthermore, it makes a brief reflection on how employing PAR in the design studio can help studio teachers to reposition design learning as a social and political practice. Building on this basis it proposes alternative ways for enabling bottom-up practices in the design studio; including a series of socially engaged tactical micro-tasks, thematic design studio assignments and design learning-in-action.

AB  - Physical inactivity is a known risk factor for obesity and a number of chronic diseases. Modifying the physical features of neighborhoods to provide residents with equitable and convenient access to spaces for physical activity (PA) is a promising strategy for promoting PA. Public urban recreation spaces (e.g., parks) play an important role in promoting PA and are potentially an important neighborhood element for optimizing social capital and liveability in cities. Most studies examining the effects of park availability and use on PA have focused on traditional, permanent parks. The aims of this study were to (1) document patterns of park use and park-based PA at a temporary urban pop-up park implemented in the downtown business district of Los Altos, California during July–August 2013 and May–June 2014, (2) identify factors associated with park-based PA in 2014, and (3) examine the effects of the 2014 pop-up park on additional outcomes of potential benefit for park users and the Los Altos community at large. Park use remained high during most hours of the day in 2013 and 2014. Although the park attracted a multigenerational group of users, children and adolescents were most likely to engage in walking or more vigorous PA at the park. Park presence was significantly associated with potentially beneficial changes in time-allocation patterns among users, including a reduction in screen-time and an increase in overall park-time and time spent outdoors. Park implementation resulted in notable use among people who would otherwise not be spending time at a park (85% of surveyed users would not be spending time at any other park if the pop-up park was not there—2014 data analysis). Our results (significantly higher odds of spending time in downtown Los Altos due to park presence) suggest that urban pop-up parks may also have broader community benefits, such as attracting people to visit downtown business districts. Pending larger, confirmatory studies, our results suggest that temporary urban pop-up parks may contribute to solving the limited access to public physical activity recreation spaces many urban residents face. © 2017, The New York Academy of Medicine.

AB  - Pocket Park, small areas that can make up for the emptiness, abandonment and no function of many spaces that are located within our cities, triggering processes of urban regeneration through the discovery of a new "life" and a new potentiality to accommodate. This must be rediscovered and brought to light so as to realize and perceive a different urban imaginary. A product of urban interior design that is confronted with large courtyards: rooms without roof, this product can improve the quality of everyday life, designed to be together and to know the other's culture, where the confrontation between people is based on the sharing of the common space, living outdoors to accommodate people and make them feel like "home", and together with the people.. with all the other. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Green activism and guerrilla gardening lie at the more informal end of the urban food growing movement, but little is known about the extent of this practice or the future of such unplanned activities. Accordingly, this paper firstly explores a range of informal Urban Agriculture practices, illuminating the practice within Europe, North America, Africa and other continents. The paper then proceeds to focus explicitly on Salford, UK, where guerrilla gardening is being encouraged by the local authority. Using ethnographic and interview data, we focus on the actors involved, their relationship with authority and the wider impact of their activities; exploring their motives, aspirations, values and beliefs. The results reveal the ability of the informal movement to regenerate ‘forgotten’ space and bring communities together, and the ‘darker’ side of the activity, with actors sometimes restricting access to colonised land. Ultimately, the paper reveals how this movement is expanding and that more research is required to better understand the actions of those who pursue a more informal approach to urban gardening and those who seek to regulate land use activity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - ‘Urban acupuncture’ to alleviate stress in informal settlements in Mexico
AU  - Lastra, A.
AU  - Pojani, D.
T2  - Journal of Urban Design
AB  - This paper explores whether smaller-scale physical space interventions (‘urban acupuncture’) have the power to alleviate the stress, social pathologies and political disengagement experienced by the residents of informal settlements. The case study is Tepito, a barrio in Mexico City. The results, based on 20 qualitative interviews with local residents, support the idea that an ‘urban acupuncture’ approach has a high potential in this respect. In view of these findings, the authors argue that an indirect approach, focused on physical space, might, at least in the short term, be more productive in empowering of informal settlement dwellers than direct efforts at political organization. Physical, economic and political spaces are intrinsically linked. Little political engagement can be expected if people live in poor physical environments. While certainly not a panacea, acupunctural interventions might trigger much broader changes than initially intended. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Increasing urbanization across the southeastern United States presents unique challenges for wildlife; however certain species have learned to adapt and thrive in these environments. Coyotes (Canis latrans), bobcats (Lynx rufus), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) are four common medium-sized carnivores that have become closely associated with urban areas. The goal for this study was to determine how urban landscape features influence density and occurrence of these species in a small urban area and to evaluate if any effects were similar to those observed in larger urban areas. We conducted two eight-week camera surveys in the city of Nacogdoches, Texas (pop. 32,699) and immediate surrounding areas in summer and fall 2013. We evaluated single-season spatially explicit capture-recapture and occupancy models to estimate density, and occurrence, respectively, based on anthropogenic and natural features around each camera site. Coyotes (fall: 1.38 coyotes/km2) and bobcats (fall: 0.64 coyotes/km2) were associated with areas of green space, but their response to large and small green spaces changed seasonally. Conversely, red foxes (fall: 2.53 red foxes/km2) were more likely to occur near developed areas and were less detectable in areas with greater probability of coyote presence in fall only. In summer, gray foxes (fall: 0.05 gray foxes/km2) were more likely to occur in areas with lower building density and closer to buildings. This study indicates coyotes, foxes and bobcats respond to small-scale urbanization in a similar manner as large-scale urbanization. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Birch pollen are known to release ice-nucleating macromolecules (INM), but little is known about the production and release of INM from other parts of the tree. We examined the ice nucleation activity of samples from 10 different birch trees (Betula spp.). Samples were taken from nine birch trees in Tyrol, Austria, and from one tree in a small urban park in Vienna, Austria. Filtered aqueous extracts of 30 samples of leaves, primary wood (new branch wood, green in colour, photosynthetically active), and secondary wood (older branch wood, brown in colour, with no photosynthetic activity) were analysed in terms of ice nucleation activity using VODCA (Vienna Optical Droplet Crystallization Analyser), a cryo microscope for emulsion samples. All samples contained ice-nucleating particles in the submicron size range. Concentrations of ice nuclei ranged from 6:7×104 to 6:1×109 mg-1 sample. Mean freezing temperatures varied between -15:6 and -31:3 °C; the range of temperatures where washes of birch pollen and dilutions thereof typically freeze. The freezing behaviour of three concentrations of birch pollen washing water (initial wash, 1 : 100, and 1 : 10 000) were significantly associated with more than a quarter of our samples, including some of the samples with highest and lowest activity. This indicates a relationship between the INM of wood, leaves, and pollen. Extracts derived from secondary wood showed the highest concentrations of INM and the highest freezing temperatures. Extracts from the leaves exhibited the highest variation in INM and freezing temperatures. Infrared spectra of the extracts and tested birch samples show qualitative similarity, suggesting the chemical components may be broadly similar. © 2018 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article aims to demonstrate that building envelopes can be designed to improve the performance of public open space in Hong Kong. It investigates how such improvement can be used to negotiate between objective and regulation in planning standards. Addressing a research site with a publicly accessible pocket park in the Mong Kok area, the article explores generative potentials at the interface between the building envelope and the zoning envelope. The objective is to demonstrate that architecture can overcome the conflict between public and private interests in urban development by shaping profitable real estate that also promotes community welfare. The research methodology for this article adheres to design research. © 2019 Firenze University Press.

TI  - Spider assemblages within greenspaces of a deindustrialized urban landscape
AU  - Burkman, C.E.
AU  - Gardiner, M.M.
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Many Midwestern cities in the United States have experienced high levels of economic decline and population loss. This deindustrialization has led to thousands of acres of vacant land maintained as grassy habitats. The communities living within these neighborhoods have conceptualized reutilization strategies for this land, including urban agriculture and the creation of small parks of native plantings. In this 2-year study, we examined the impacts of vacant land conversion on spiders within residential vacant lots, community gardens, and planted prairies within the peri-urban park system. At the time of the study, planted prairies on previously vacant land were not common, so those within the park system may serve as a foundation for future plantings. We found that maintained vacant lots contained the most numerous spider assemblages, which was dominated by disturbance-tolerant habitat generalist species. Community gardens contained numerically fewer spiders but a slightly richer assemblage than vacant lots. Similarly low numbers were also found in planted prairies but the assemblage was the most diverse of the greenspaces examined. We also contrasted results at the family versus genus level in order to assess the taxonomic sufficiency relevant for future studies, and found that genus level was important for elucidating the effects of urban land use on these spider assemblages. From this research, we conclude that spiders are an important indicator group of disturbance when examining urban greenspace management and revitalization, and that alteration in greenspace design will influence biodiversity and assemblage composition. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Exploring guerrilla gardening: gauging public views on the grassroots activity
AU  - Adams, D.
AU  - Hardman, M.

T2  - Local Environment
AB  - The literature on guerrilla gardening is developing rapidly. The majority of these accounts currently derive from North America, with little academic exploration apparent beyond this context: they focus explicitly on the grass-roots gardeners and show little regard for those surrounding the action's location. Guerrilla gardeners often colonise land not only without the permission from authorities, but also with little regard for those who surround the space; transforming areas without consulting with the local communities. This paper explores those affected by guerrilla gardening; grounding our argument in evidence gathered from the activities of three guerrilla groups. In doing so, we investigate the public's views of several informal gardening projects, questioning their value and impact on the surrounding areas. The emerging responses are very mixed, ranging from positive comments about improving aesthetics, to negative remarks surrounding the practices of some groups. Ultimately, this paper demonstrates how, although often promoted and perceived to be a constructive activity, guerrilla gardening can result in adverse impacts on those who surround colonised sites. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

T2  - Sustainable Cities and Society
AB  - Urban green spaces can mitigate urban warming problems to some extent. However, the cooling effect of plants differs spatially and temporally, and with plant features. To understand how plants affect urban surface and air temperature, 15 urban green spaces in Suzhou Industrial Park were selected to study the diurnal variation of summer air temperature. At the same time, the mitigation effect of different types of green spaces on the urban heat island (UHI) effect was investigated and further research was undertaken on the effect of green space area, perimeter area ratio, green space average canopy density, average leaf area index (LAI), and other factors influencing the cooling effect. Based on these studies, three representative parks were selected as samples to investigate the cooling effect of urban green space in terms of the water and wind environment. It was found that in the summer, large green spaces had a stable cooling and humidifying effect, while small green spaces had the opposite effect. The cooling and humidifying effect of large green spaces was more obvious and stable, and the cooling effect of small green spaces was more variable, with a heat preservation phenomenon occurring in some cases. The cooling effect of each green area was positively correlated with the green area, the average LAI of green space, and the average canopy density of green space. The cooling effect of each green area was significantly negatively correlated with the green area perimeter. Water bodies within green spaces did not contribute to cooling; however, the cooling effect was related to the wind environment. From the perspective of the planning and construction of city green spaces it is important to increase the green area and the reasonable planning green perimeter area ratio; however, suitable tree species should be selected in the greening process. The effect of urban greening in improving the urban ecological environment has been established. It was concluded that the cooling effects of such green areas are largely determined by plant type, canopy density, and park shapes. Therefore, it is suggested that a stronger emphasis is placed on the selection of plant species and the design of park shapes to achieve environmental cooling effects. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Public parks contribute to neighbourhood quality of life, promote a more public daily life, serve as important focal points for neighbourhoods, and provide access to nearby nature as part of the built environment. Parks have a special role in the range of public space as a part of sustainable land use planning and development. Good design helps position them for relevant cultural and ecological roles. This research identified design principles that good, small urban parks share–including accessibility, specificity, authenticity, functionality, and adaptability–applicable in smaller cities, towns, and lower density areas. The framework was subsequently tested using interviews, remote and observational analysis in locations representing this variety of settings in the Southeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeastern United States. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Urban green spaces provide a habitat for a wide variety of bird species. However, changes in characteristics of the surrounding urban morphology could influence the contribution of such green spaces. In particular, bird communities inhabiting small urban parks (SUPs) may be vulnerable, given the high exposure of these spaces to surrounding conditions. In Neotropical cities, the influence of urban-matrix characteristics on bird communities found in SUPs is relatively unknown. In this study, we explored if an increase in surrounding urban matrix variables, such as building densities, average building height, and road coverage around SUPs, negatively influenced the richness and abundance of the bird communities inhabiting them. We tested the effects of matrix and several site-level variables (e.g., vegetation diversity) across 60 SUPs in Santiago, Chile. As the matrix around a SUP had increased building densities, bird richness and abundance of native and insectivorous species decreased and invasive, urban-dweller, and omnivorous species increased. As road coverage increased, both the richness and abundance tended to decrease across all bird categories. For site-level variables, SUP size, distance to nearest SUP, and native vegetation diversity had a significant effect on several bird categories. Our results indicate that city planners may need to take into account both the surrounding urban matrix and site-level characteristics in order to improve bird diversity within SUPs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The concept of urban acupuncture, which has been gaining ground in recent decades, is based on the activation and revitalization of urban environments using small architectural or landscape architectural interventions in precise carefully selected locations of urban fabric. However, the rapid and unexpected design solutions of urban acupuncture, based on ecological design, nature dynamics, street art, material re-use, can cause different social and psychological reactions of urban population and these reactions may vary depending on cultural contexts. Consequently, in order to implement successful urban acupuncture projects in Lithuanian cities, it is very important to find out public opinion and priorities in the fields of public space management, aesthetics, and public art. The aim of the research was to analyze the opinion of Kaunas city residents regarding these issues. For this purpose, a sociological questionnaire survey was used. The questionnaire containing 20 questions was designed, with the aim to find out the trends of use of public spaces in the city, the attitudes of residents towards street art and other small-scale initiatives in public spaces implemented in the recent years, possibilities of creating landscape architecture based on ecological ideas in urban environment, the attitude of inhabitants towards community spaces and community space design in the city, etc. 100 residents of Kaunas participated in this online administered survey. The survey has demonstrated general positive attitude towards contemporary design trends of public spaces and public art; however, the surveyed population expressed preferences towards fully equipped public spaces offering possibilities for a wide range of activities. © Scientific Journal of Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.; Pēdējos gadu desmitos populārs ir kļuvis urbānās akupunktūras koncepts, kas ir balstīts uz urbānās vides aktivizēšanu un revitalizāciju, izmantojot nelielu arhitektūras vai ainavu arhitektūras iejaukšanos noteiktās vietās urbānajā vidē. Tomēr urbānās akupunktūras netradicionālie dizaina risinājumi, kas pārsvarā balstīti uz ekologisku dizainu, dabas ritumu, ielu mākslu un pārstrādājamiem materiāliem, var izsaukt dažādas reakcijas.

T2  - Journal of Urbanism
AB  - How did one of the most historically automobile-dependent US cities end up with the first large-scale modern US bike-sharing system? The story reveals that it is less about transportation demand planning and engineering and more about the principles of what has been termed tactical urbanism. The tactical urbanism movement revolves around the idea that temporary interventions can help one understand what interventions might work in a particular context and lay the foundation for more permanent ones. That the first large-scale bike-sharing system in the US began as such an intervention is quite remarkable and illustrative of the potential of this strategy to build public aspiration and political will via temporary, short-term empirical success. Beginning with preparations for the 2008 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Denver, Colorado, this paper details what went into creating the temporary Freewheel!n bike-share system and how that was able to be leveraged into a permanent bike-sharing system, Denver B-Cycle, two years later. Consistent with the characteristics of tactical urbanism, the partnerships formed with the temporary DNC implementation served as a catalyst. The paper then identifies lessons that other cities can learn and apply in similar large-scale tactical urbanism interventions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Field measurements and numerical modelling were used to study the acoustic performance of a low screen in an urban road setting. The results show the usefulness of low screens as well as suggests improvements in screen design. For the measurements, an acoustic screen built up from concrete modules was temporarily installed beside a small park on the reservation between a two-lane road and a track for walking and cycling. A larger traffic system, of which the two-lane road is a part, determines the daytime equivalent noise level within the urban area. The screen height was about 1.4 m as measured from the level of the road surface and the width of the screen top was 0.3 m. Measurements were carried out both at 20 m distance from the road (within the park) and at 5 m distance from the road (at the cycle track). Insertion loss in maximum level, using controlled light-vehicle pass-by at 50 km/h, was measured to 10 dB at 5 m distance and to 6 dB at 20 m distance, at 1.5 m height. Insertion loss in equivalent level was measured within the park to 4 dB at 1.5 m height. A listening experiment confirmed a perceived improvement from installing the screen. The measured results were also compared with predicted results using a boundary element method (BEM) and a noise mapping software, the latter showing good agreement, overestimating the equivalent level insertion loss by 1 dB in the park. The BEM comparison showed reasonable agreement in maximum level insertion loss considering that facade reflections were excluded, with an overestimation of 5 dB at the cycle track, and good agreement in the park, overestimating by up to 1 dB the equivalent and maximum level insertion losses. BEM predictions were used to also investigate other screen designs, showing a positive effect of an acoustically soft screen top, significant for a screen width of 0.2 m and increasing for wider screens. © S.

AB  - This article makes a critical reflection, questioning the notion of historical urban landscapes as a conceptual paradigm used for the basis of urban conservation in the twenty-first century. The study begins with a brief summary of the origins and subsequent evolution of this concept, highlighting the two key reference milestones: the Vienna Memorandum (UNESCO, 2005) and the Paris Recommendation (UNESCO, 2011). Subsequently, the focus of attention will be on highlighting the problems and difficulties posed by the management and protection of historic urban landscapes today. In this sense, the focus of attention will be placed on the assumption that change is an inherent part of the urban condition, since there is no consensus on what the limits of acceptable change in historic urban landscapes should be. It also emphasizes three factors that make this more difficult: (1) the reminiscences of the doctrines of the Weberian administration in the current models of government; (2) the subjective nature of the systems of indicators applied to the scope of historic cities; and (3) the opportunism of tactical urbanism, which, despite its shortcomings, is becoming an outstanding alternative for the methodological development of the historic urban landscapes. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Dispersion of traffic derived air pollutants into urban parks
AU  - Xing, Y.

T2  - Science of the Total Environment
AB  - Scarce land resources in dense cities means that small urban parks are important as a leisure and amenity resource for the urban population. However, streets with heavily traffic often surround these fragmented parks and increase the potential user exposure to air pollutants from vehicles. The dispersion profiles of PM2.5 and black carbon from roadside into urban parks at pedestrian level, in Hong Kong, were measured using mobile high time resolution instruments. In the downwind direction, pollutant concentrations decreased rapidly from roadside and by some tens of metres reached relatively constant values. An even sharper gradient is found in the upwind direction, with a rapid increase detected within 2 m of the road edge. The distinct decay profiles were explained with an analytical dispersion model formulated based on the gradient transport theory using an Eulerian approach. The simulations using the dispersion model suggest 17 m as a typical halving distance under normal urban conditions, which is introduced to simplify the description of dispersion profiles. Using Hong Kong as an example, ~ 90% of urban parks, to different extent, overlap with the 17 m halving distance from roads, which means few urban parks in Hong Kong avoid the impact from nearby traffic emissions. Thus, from the perspective of human exposure to air pollutants in urban parks, this study provides observations of relevance for future park design in dense cities. © 2017

TI  - Asking ‘Third World questions’ of First World informality: Using Southern theory to parse needs from desires in an analysis of informal urbanism of the global North
AU  - Devlin, R.T.
T2  - Planning Theory
AB  - Long a subject of study in the global South, the topic of citizen-driven, bottom-up, non-professionally produced urbanism has received increasing attention in professional and academic planning circles of the global North. This newfound focus on informal urbanism in the North is a welcome development, but, taken as a whole, Northern literature concerning informality is characterized by conceptual imprecision and an indeterminate analysis of the politics of informal actions and actors. As such, it fails to provide meaningful guidance to planners concerned with urban poverty, social justice, equity, and inclusion. This article attempts to resolve some of these problems by focusing on one key area of conceptual slippage in the literature: the failure to differentiate between informality born of desire and that born of need. This results in a flattened analysis of the political ramifications of informal actions and the political subjectivity of informal actors. In this article, I review the existing literature in order to point out some of these shortcomings. I then suggest that planners in the North have much to learn about informal urbanism from their counterparts working in and on Southern cities. I attempt to reconcile these two bodies of literature, arguing that Southern theory can help Northern planners develop a more nuanced, politically sophisticated approach to informal urbanism. © The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - Assessing urban forest structure, ecosystem services, and economic benefits on vacant land
AU  - Kim, G.
T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - An urban forest assessment is essential for developing a baseline from which to measure changes and trends. The most precise way to assess urban forests is to measure and record every tree on a site, but although this may work well for relatively small populations (e.g,; street trees, small parks), it is prohibitively expensive for large tree populations. Thus, random sampling offers a cost-effective way to assess urban forest structure and the associated ecosystem services for large-scale assessments. The methodology applied to assess ecosystem services in this study can also be used to assess the ecosystem services provided by vacant land in other urban contexts and improve urban forest policies, planning, and the management of vacant land. The study's findings support the inclusion of trees on vacant land and contribute to a new vision of vacant land as a valuable ecological resource by demonstrating how green infrastructure can be used to enhance ecosystem health and promote a better quality of life for city residents. © 2016.

AB  - Green spaces in the city are important for human wellbeing, but are also zones in which humans can become infected with zoonotic diseases. Therefore, there is a need to understand how infection risk is related to green space characteristics, wildlife communities and connectivity with rural areas hosting reservoir populations of hosts. Our hypothesis is that wildlife hosts in urban green spaces, and thereby the prevalence of questing ticks and their Lyme disease causing pathogens (Borrelia burgdorferi s.l.), can be partly predicted based on green space characteristics as well as measures of connectivity to known source areas. We sampled ticks in twenty-two green spaces during Spring (2014 and 2016) and Autumn 2016, located along an urbanization gradient in Antwerp (Belgium). More than 18,000 m                             2                              was sampled, with tick densities ranging from 0 to 386 individuals/100 m                             2                             . We estimated connectivity using the least-cost algorithm as either the cost distance to the nearest green space, or to a known population of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), known to be an important tick propagation host. Both connectivity measures turned out to be correlated, reflecting a gradient in green space isolation from the periphery to the urban center. In 87% of plots where ticks were trapped, at least one Borrelia-infected tick was found. The overall Borrelia-prevalence in nymphs was 17.8%, in adults 32.6%. Density of infected ticks decreased with urbanization and increased with connectivity. Nymphs in larger green spaces were more likely to be infected. While density and infection prevalence for adults increased with the amount of neighboring agricultural land, the larval density and nymphal infection prevalence decreased. Interestingly, the proportion of Borrelia genospecies associated with birds or mammals was comparable in rural and (sub)urban areas (bird/mammal: 0.38), suggesting that even in small green spaces Borrelia infections can persist in local host populations.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Urban Geography
AB  - Through a qualitative analysis of pop-up landscapes on Philadelphia’s Delaware Waterfront, this paper examines how entrepreneurial urban actors, such as municipal officials, urban planning agencies, and landscape designers, strategically harness to catalyze investment. While pop-up landscapes have disrupted negative associations with the waterfront, providing a space for people to reimagine the city and playing an active role as an integrative public space, the paper argues that there are reasons to be skeptical about the long-term goals the pop-up landscapes serve, given the widespread focus on real estate-led development. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Does urbanization affect the seasonal dynamics of bird communities in urban parks?
AU  - Leveau, L.M.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - The environmental factors affecting the spatial dynamics of bird communities in urban parks are well understood, but much less attention has been paid to the seasonal dynamics of bird communities. Since migrant and resident human commensal birds might have contrasting responses to environmental factors of urban parks, we expected different seasonal dynamics among parks. On the other hand, because bird species can have different habitat relationships throughout the year, we also expected different responses of bird richness to environmental variables between breeding and non-breeding seasons. Bird surveys were conducted in 14 small urban parks (1–4 Ha) of Mar del Plata city (Argentina) for one full annual cycle. Bird richness changed between seasons, but bird abundance remained constant. Bird community composition did not vary between seasons, but urban parks near the urban center, with the highest pedestrian traffic and isolation to other green areas had the least seasonal change of composition. During the breeding season, bird richness was negatively affected by the percentage cover of high buildings surrounding the immediate limits of parks, whereas during the non-breeding season bird richness was not related with any environmental variable. Bird composition variation among parks was affected by the distance to the urban center during both seasons. Results showed that urbanization promotes a seasonal homogenization of bird communities in urban parks, probably by affecting the presence of migrant species and promoting the temporal stability of human commensal species. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AU  - De Smet, A.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - In this paper, the process behind the making of the Boerenhof Park on an urban Waiting Space in Ghent (Belgium) is discussed. We are highlighting how in this case ‘tactical urbanism’ actions, such as planting a tree, turned out to have a long-term impact and as such can inform a ‘tactical urban planning’ approach. Through a learning by reflection method, the Boerenhof Park case has been re-analysed using a conceptual framework built up around the concepts of ‘scratch’ ‘scar’ and ‘score’. The focus was on discerning the transgressional elements for moving from short-term interventions to long-term change. Three key aspects are brought to light: the incremental approach, a desire-driven program, and a transversal collaboration. We argue that these are key aspects for the operationalisation of a tactical urban planning approach. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Creating “people’s park”: Toward a redefinition of urban space
AU  - Robinson, E.
T2  - Human Ecology Review
AB  - This study examines the development of an urban space, from a vacant lot to a usable public space as a public park, in order to analyze how the transformation of space affects meaning for the surrounding community. I ask: In what ways does this transformation empower individuals to take advantage of subsequent reuse opportunities? Does the process by which the change takes place influence subsequent community engagement opportunities? I argue that how the spatial transformation is organized influences the potential environmental and social justice opportunities that can be created for community members, and thus its impact on the community dynamic of the defined space. For this analysis, I examine how the transformation of space affects human social interaction in a community which, historically, has been racially and economically marginalized. The development of the space was spurred by organizers who felt a public “pocket park” would add value to the community, as well as provide a space for social interaction to take place between community residents. Implemented with little engagement from community residents, I document the transformation of this space-and the positive and negative consequences of the transformation for residents-using participant observation, in-depth interviewing, and content analysis. © 2019, Society for Human Ecology.

TI  - Delai Sam: social activism as contemporary art in the emerging discourse of DIY urbanism in Russia
AU  - Enigbokan, A.
T2  - Journal of Urbanism
AB  - Delai sam (do it yourself) is a deeply rooted phenomenon in Russian life. However, as a form of contemporary art, this phenomenon has taken on an activist tenor in post-socialist urban Russia. Founded in 2010, the Delai Sam Festival of Urban Actions represents a politicized approach to DIY urbanism in today’s Russia, in which artists, designers, activists and scholars are joining together to develop alternatives to official visions for the design and planning of their cities. This article critically examines the discourse of the first few Delai Sam festivals in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and related urban interventions, to understand how these actions are both situated within their local context, and linked discursively to global trends in art and urban activism. DIY actions like Delai Sam open windows into the convergence of art and social activism, the aesthetic and the political, currently taking shape within the global city. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Reducing architecture: Doing almost nothing as a city-making strategy in 21st century architecture
AU  - Enia, M.
AU  - Martella, F.
T2  - Frontiers of Architectural Research
AB  - This paper discusses a contemporary design strategy to deal with urban spaces. In 21st century architecture it is possible to recognize the existence of several projects that consist in doing almost nothing, carrying out only minimal modifications to their sites of intervention. In present-day architecture, this approach is considered useful sometimes to respect the surroundings and sometimes to improve them through the smallest and tiniest actions. Doing almost nothing is a strategy that can unfold in many ways. It can mean opting for inaction and thus not modifying a place at all; or designing a temporary project intended to occupy it only for a limited period of time; or also carrying out a particularly small but permanent intervention. Depending on the circumstances, it is an approach that can help architecture protecting a place, reclaiming it or reactivating its latent qualities. This strategy can be implemented both through a single intervention on a specific place, or through a network of coordinated projects in different locations. The purpose of the paper is to present this approach in the context of 21st century urban architecture, through cases studied from the last two decades. © 2019 Higher Education Press Limited Company

TI  - SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF SURFACE URBAN HEAT ISLAND BASED ON LANDSAT ETM+ AND OLI/TIRS IMAGERY IN THE CITY OF KOŠICE, SLOVAKIA

AB  - The availability of multispectral imagery including a thermal infrared band enabled monitoring the spatial pattern of land surface temperature (LST) and linking it with land cover properties. Multispectral data archives allow for assessing the dynamics of urban heat island (UHI) by the means of LST mapping for particular area. The research on UHI has been focused on large cities where the phenomenon is the most pronounced. However, UHI concerns also smaller cities which are more abundant and over a half of urban population lives in cities with less than a half of million inhabitants. Therefore, this paper focuses on assessing the pattern of the UHI in the city of Košice as an example of a typical small post-communist Central European city after changes of urban landscape induced by transition to capitalism and modern trends in economy. We demonstrate the effect of urban greenery on the UHI phenomenon in Košice using the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery and ground-based weather station data. We determine differences in the LST distribution in the city under various weather conditions in the vegetation season from 2013 to 2015. The results revealed the spatial pattern of the LST and UHI in Košice which is unique from regional perspective. Globally, the results support the hypotesis that UHI poses problem even in such a small city. Expansion of urban fabric by construction of new residential, commercial and industrial estates and also building new traffic infrastructure in last few years amplified the UHI. Strong correlation was calculated between the LST and the amount of urban greenery in the city. Even narrow green alleys or small parks are capable of mitigating the UHI phenomenon which can be a usefull argument for officials in Košice but also in other cities to support investments in development of green areas. © 2018.

TI  - Gezi park protests in Turkey: How can death be related to the protests?
AU  - Koca-Atabey, M.
T2  - Journal of Balkan and Near Eastern Studies
AB  - The aim of the paper is to investigate the Gezi Park Protests in Turkey from the perspective of terror management theory (TMT). The Gezi Park Protests started at the end of May 2013 to defend the destruction of a small park. The protests started with environmentalist reactions and acquired a political nature afterwards. The roles of social media and humour are also discussed in relation to the different dimensions of the Gezi Park Protests. TMT, more specifically the mortality salience hypothesis, is used to explain these protests, since they include both the concrete and abstract forms of mortality. The concrete forms of death were the death of trees and the death of protesters themselves. The abstract forms of death, on the other hand, were the death of lifestyle from the protesters’ perspective and death of exercise power from the government’s side. Three necessary conditions for an alternative experimental manipulation in TMT studies are discussed in relation to the Gezi Park Protests. It is concluded that the protests provided a concrete and real-life example of TMT. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Many cities are facing water shortages because of climate change. Climate adaptation plans have prioritized water saving to prevent the devastating consequences of drought. To develop such adaptation plans, it is critical to understand the water-use patterns of cities. The present research determines the water consumption for irrigation of green spaces and residential gardens in metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile (MAS) and compares this consumption with the expected vegetation water requirements estimated using a hydrological model. The monthly water consumption was obtained from a database of drinking water meters provided by the private water utility serving most of the MAS, which includes 110 large parks and 1882 small parks. The MAS shows higher water consumption during the summer dry months (November to April). The water use for irrigation is higher than the modelled demand of vegetation, which entails a significant chance to save water. The irrigation rate of public spaces is lower than private spaces, and closer to the modelled demand. In all cases, the landscaping based on extensive lawn surfaces seems to be the main driver of over-irrigation. Further research is required to study the trade-offs between the urban green benefits and the costs of irrigation in semi-arid and Mediterranean cities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Tactical Urbanism: Delineating a Critical Praxis
AU  - Webb, D.
T2  - Planning Theory and Practice
AB  - The economic crisis has triggered the popularisation and roll out of various forms of informal urbanism, aimed at influencing the future shape of places as well as the way they are governed. A particular strand within this, sometimes referred to as ‘tactical urbanism’, has attracted attention due to its potential to inspire progressive place making. However, the hybrid nature of the politics involved has not yet been unpicked. This paper addresses this gap and then uses this analysis to support a critical, materialist praxis informed by actor–network theory. An experimental case study provides a means of reflecting on this approach. © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Increase in public awareness toward high quality living environment led landscape being seen as the important component of urban environment in Malaysia. The landscape beautification projects of protocol roads, pocket parks, urban squares, promenades and urban woodland were found to give positive impact on the quality of life of the urban area. However, issue of green space availability in urban area requires new approach. The landscape beautification project has been now changed into more integrated Urban Landscape Program (ULP). The ULP emphasizes regeneration of urban green spaces to ensure sustainability. This paper will further discuss the way forward in sustaining the urban landscape development program in Malaysia as part of the effort to create sustainable cities through effective landscape planning. © 2017 WIT Press.

TI  - Ecosystem services management: An evaluation of green adaptations for urban development in Dhaka, Bangladesh
AU  - Zinia, N.J.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - We evaluated green adaptation strategies (parks, gardens, green roof, rainwater harvest, green façades/wall, porous pavement, and green and blue belts) in the context of urban development and potential climate change impacts for the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our review of relevant literature revealed substantial environmental (cooler and cleaner environment), economic (reduced energy demand, avoided cost of drainage maintenance, increased land values) and social (higher social interaction, improved mental and physical health) benefits arising from the maintenance and development of ecosystem services in major cities. Our evaluation of green adaptation strategies was undertaken with household surveys in three wards of Dhaka, expert interviews, and our personal experiences. Rooftop gardens/agriculture had very high social acceptance (85%) and economic feasibility and was commonly practiced in Dhaka, particularly among house owners. Pocket park, green roof, rainwater harvest, green façades/wall, porous pavement, and community garden were all considered to be highly feasible for implementation with collective efforts but had lower social acceptance. Many respondents were unwilling to pay for green adaptation strategies even knowing their benefits. Our research revealed that successful implementation of beneficial green adaptation will require public participation at all stages supported through awareness raising campaigns. Enforcement of laws and strong commitment from the government was also considered to be beneficial. However, more transparent cost-benefit analyses promoting the conservation of ecosystem services is required, particularly for resource-poor Dhaka. Green adaptations make cities more resilient to pressures from demographic change and climate change increasingly relevant in the developing world. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AU  - Furchtlehner, J.

T2  - Journal of Landscape Architecture
AB  - The paper presents a comparative study on neighbourhood streets in the densely populated cities of Rotterdam, Copenhagen, Munich, and Vienna. First, urban development is contextualized in a brief history of alternative street development approaches. Then, the current measures and strategies to transform streets into sufficient public spaces for a growing number of people are investigated. The analysis of street sections in the four cities revealed significant differences in the existing street layout but also similar planning strategies, a similar approach to the appropriation, and an aesthetics of informality in certain cases. Discussing the cities’ policies towards this reclamation, the paper shows how contemporary measures go beyond the simple recovery of traffic lanes for cyclists or creating pedestrian walkways. A conclusion is drawn that top-down building and design measures are merging with bottom-up or activated civic engagement and although the streets observed are in good condition, barrier-free, and well-maintained, improvements for streets as living environments are at an early stage. © 2019, © 2019 European Council of Landscape Architecture Schools (ECLAS).

T2  - Cities
AB  - This paper is situated amidst concerns that public spaces are diminishing in both quantity and quality (Low & Smith, 2006), with this trend exacerbated by the excising of state budgets for their provision, maintenance or development, their privatisation and/or devolution of their management to corporate interests. Here we interrogate what ‘public space’ is using the lens of temporary use projects undertaken on privately-owned land. As a distinct form of DIY urbanism, it could be argued that temporary use projects might be least likely to promote enduring change but, in this paper, we demonstrate that it is their very transience that enables the interstices between the actual and the possible to be exploited in innovative ways. We explore how a distinctive methodology associated with temporary use projects, and a reconceptualisation of what public space is, creates new opportunities to restore the emancipatory potential of (increasingly) emaciated public places. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Hegel’s Hipsters: Claiming Ownership in the Contemporary City
AU  - Thorpe, A.
T2  - Social and Legal Studies
AB  - Property is both revered and reviled. Praised for its connections to autonomy, agency, power and community, property attracts scorching critiques for its implication in exclusion, inequality and injustice. This article provides a new perspective from which to examine this dual nature of property. Drawing on fieldwork in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, property is examined in the context of citizen and community-led ‘do-it-yourself’ interventions in the urban environment. Perhaps even more than in formal planning processes, claims about ownership are central to these activities. Finding multiple forms of property at work in the city, and noting that formal legal title is often less important than more informal ownership, this article sheds new light on some of the oldest debates in property. Amongst echoes of Lockean labour-based theory, Hegelian personhood theory emerges as particularly helpful in explaining the intimate connections between property and identity, community and power in the city. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - An analysis of the birds in Bangkok’s urban parks and landscapes provided guidance in designing healthy urban ecosystems. This research studied the relationships between bird diversity, park size, distance to the nearest main park, and habitat compositions in 10 urban parks in the Bangkok metropolitan area between January and August in 2013. Thirty sampling points per park were used to observe the number and species of birds in each urban park. A total of 50 bird species were found. Phutthamonthon, the largest urban park (400 ha), contained the greatest number of species (39 species), followed by Suan Luang Rama IX (80 ha and 34 species) and Wachirabenchatat (60 ha and 29 species). Moreover, the diversity index (H′) was highest in Phuttamonthon (1.17), followed by Thawiwanarom (1.08), and Wachirabenchatat (1.04). Larger urban parks and parks closer to the largest urban park had higher species richness than smaller parks and parks further from the largest urban park. The large parks contain higher habitat compositions than small parks. These findings can be applied to future urban ecosystem planning to combine the importance of park size (island size, and its proximity to a large park) and its arrangement, including features such as wetland, forest, buildings and grassland; and provide basic advice for future urban park design, as well as re-design of current urban parks. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Urban acupuncture: Producing water in informal settlements
AU  - Cerro, C.
T2  - WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment
AB  - According to the United Nations, the world number of urban inhabitants is estimated to grow from the 3.9 billion at present, to 6.3 billion people by 2050. The vast majority of this population surplus is expected to be absorbed by informal settlements, where the inhabitants will have to deal with inadequate or non-existent water, health or sanitation systems. At present, more than 156 million urban dwellers, live without immediate access to water. A situation that can be remedied by implementing urban proposals following the principles of Urban Acupuncture, by which small scale interventions are designed to produce large scale social change. At any given time, there are 3.1 quadrillion gallons of water in the atmosphere which if tapped could solve water scarcity. The yearly humidity average of cities like Karachi in Pakistan or Mumbai in India is around 70%. Making them the perfect sites for the use of atmospheric water generator, since these devises are designed to produce water from humidity levels as low as 35%. A single atmospheric water generator can produce up to 5000 litters of clean filtered water a day. Each of the proposed architectural interventions presented below, would house a minimum of four generators, producing 20,000 liters of a water a day. Functioning as a hive, these water towers would be placed at multiple social nodes within an informal settlement, potentially solving the water crisis by producing clean, filtered, free, accessible water and by doing so eliminating health and sanitation issues. The proposed case study presented in this paper is the result of an ongoing evolution of ideas on social design, developed to address water scarcity in informal settlements while also trying to hybridize the proposed intervention to tackle other water related issues that deal with nutrition and access to food. The idea is to create a network of interdependent facilities that directly serve a large number of people through architectural interventions that require minimal maintenance and the possibility of creating local jobs while helping solve the water and food crisis in informal settlements around the developing world. © 2018 WIT Press

AU  - Gibson, H.

T2  - Community Development
AB  - Concern for resources and energy, as well as limited physical space, has created a market for communities that use compact development with small residential lots to achieve efficient design. The Stapleton development in Denver, Colorado, is a smart growth, new urban-style community that offers shared neighborhood pocket parks to residents instead of large individual yards for outdoor activities. Our study assesses resident perceptions of pocket parks as an alternative to private yards and investigates pocket parks as places that foster community interaction. This article is informed by two empirical studies: a park preference survey and a series of walking interviews held with community members. We found that, in Stapleton, pocket parks do help foster community interaction and are generally perceived as a positive community amenity. Our study contributes to the discourse on social interaction in communal spaces, particularly in smart growth, new urban-style developments where pocket parks are offered in lieu of large residential yards. © 2016 Community Development Society.

T2  - Journal of Environmental Planning and Management
AB  - Green spaces are an integral part of a vibrant urban landscape. In this paper, we discuss the potential for social innovations to transform urban green space and cities. By introducing the concept of socio-ecological practices and applying it to the analysis of urban and guerrilla gardening in the cities of Groningen and London, we examine links between behavioural drivers, social innovation and green space governance. Based on document analysis, in-depth interviews and observation of gardens, we bring about an understanding of the motivations behind involvement in socio-ecological practices as an interface between people and their cities. We show how underlying motivations, including values and self-efficacy, offer insight on current place-keeping transformations and, by doing so, contribute to fostering sustainable, long-term governance dynamics. It emerges from this research that socio-ecological practices have the potential to generate socially innovative physical, social and policy transformations within the governance of urban green space. © 2017 Newcastle University.

T2  - International Journal of Simulation: Systems, Science and Technology
AB  - In order to explore the change of Green Space in Suzhou, a central City in China’s Yangtze River Delta, and reveal the spatial characteristics, ecological benefits and its impact mechanism, this study extracted a distribution map of the patches of green spaces in Suzhou using Landsat remote-sensing image data from 1998 and 2007, analyzed and assessed the changes in scale and spatial layout of the green spaces using various landscape metrics including CA, PLAND, PD, MPS, LPI, NP, PD, TE, ED, MPI, and LSI. The result indicated that the scale of the green space and the number of the patches in Suzhou decreased significantly, the discrete degree of green space in each area increased in different extent, and the connectivity decreased clearly. More of the small green space patches have disappeared. The green space totally exhibited tendencies of decline and contraction. Green space patches were unevenly distributed in Suzhou. The green space patches in old urban area were founded to be less in quantity, poor in connectivity, and maximal in discrete distance. While the new urban area of Suzhou retained a large number of cultivated land, water and woodland, and there was no distinct rank difference from suburban country. In northern area like Taicang, Changshu and Zhangjiagang districts, the green space increased in scale, and it tended to be large, concentrated and stable in pattern. While in central and southern districts, the green space decreased in different level. Particularly, the green space of Wujiang and Kunshan in the southeast had the highest decrement rate, and the green space patterns turned to be fragmented for getting disturbed by urbanization. © 2016, UK Simulation Society.

TI  - Working towards design solutions for the water and nutrition crisis of informal settlements
AU  - Cerro, C.
T2  - International Journal of Environmental Impacts
AB  - According to the World Water Assessment Program, today, half the world’s population lives in urban areas. Because of this, many of the world cities are growing exponentially and unchecked urban sprawl is spawning areas that lack water infrastructure. The vast majority of these people will be living in crowded informal settlements with inadequate, sometimes non-existent, water and sanitation services. The poor as always, are the first to suffer. Globally, an estimated 2,000 children (UNICEF) under the age of five die every day from diarrheal diseases and of these some 1,800 deaths are linked to water, sanitation and hygiene. Extending safe drinking water to the 180 million urban dwellers currently lacking it, will play a key role in improving the health and security of cities, protecting economies and ecosystems, and minimizing the risk of pandemics. With this in mind, this paper will cover an ongoing design process that started in 2012, for the development of water generating facilities to be implemented as independent, self-sufficient interventions within impoverished communities. Each one of the proposed buildings will use atmospheric water generators to produce water from the humidity in the air, which will be re-mineralized and stored for free access by the communities around them. A small percentage of the water produced will also be used to feed a mushroom and hydroponic vegetable farm within the building, designed to provide cheap and accessible nourishment to the neighborhood. Ultimately, a network of interdependent facilities could be placed around the informal settlements creating a hive that would function more as urban acupuncture than urban development, producing a financially feasible proposal designed to directly serve a community through architectural interventions that require minimal maintenance and the possibility of creating local jobs while helping solve the water and food crisis in informal settlements around the developing world. © 2019 WIT Press.

TI  - Public pedagogies of arts-based environmental learning and education for adults
AU  - Walter, P.
AU  - Earl, A.
T2  - European Journal for Research on the Education and Learning of Adults
AB  - This paper examines how current theorizing on public pedagogy can be used to understand scholarship on creative, arts-based pedagogies in informal environmental education for adults. In particular, the study applies Biesta’s (2012, 2014) typology of public pedagogies to three bodies of literature: arts-based adult learning and education in the environmental movement, eco-art, and Tactical Urbanism, respectively. Each of these is about public art, displayed or performed in public spaces, and connected to environmental learning and education. The scholarship reviewed came mostly from Canada and Australia. In the public, democratic spaces of these countries, we found that arts in the environmental movement and eco-art could be characterized by Biesta’s pedagogy of the public, and partially by a pedagogy in the interest of publicness. The performance of Tactical Urbanism corresponded most closely to pedagogy in the interest of publicness. The paper concludes with a discussion of directions for further theorizing and research on public pedagogy and arts-based environmental learning and education for adults. © 2017 The authors.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the types and structures of small green spaces (SGs) that effectively reduce air temperature in urban blocks. Six highly developed blocks in Seoul, South Korea served as the research sites for this study. Air temperature was measured at the street level with mobile loggers on clear summer days from August to September in 2012. The measurements were repeated three times a day for three days. By analyzing the spatial characteristics, SGs within the six blocks were categorized into the four major types: polygonal, linear, single, and mixed. The result revealed that the polygonal and mixed types of SGs showed simple linear regression at a significant level (p < 0.01). It indicated that the blocks’ urban heat island (UHI) mitigation (ΔTRmn) increased in a linear fashion when the area and volume of these two types of green spaces increased. The area and volume of a polygonal SG with mixed vegetation, over 300 m2 and 2300 m3, respectively, lowered the ΔTRmn by 1 °C; SG with an area and volume of larger than 650 m2 and 5000 m3, respectively, lowered the ΔTRmn by 2 °C. The results of this study will be useful to urban planners and designers for determine the types and structures of urban green spaces to optimize the cooling effect, as well as how such green spaces should be designed and distributed. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Recovering subsidized housing developments in northern México: The critical role of public space in community building in the context of a crime and violence crisis
AU  - Montemayor, G.D.
T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - México has subsidized and builtmillions of low-income homes and thousands of subdivisions in the period of 2000-2012. These occupied and expanded urban peripheries far away from work, learn, service, commerce, and recreational amenity centers. These communities had no chance to offer a high quality of life. They were rapidly abandoned and deteriorated physically and socially. Amid the still ongoing crime and violence, inhabitants experienced a loss of trust in their neighbors, a deep sense of insecurity, and consequently reduced public life and activity to a minimum. This article describes and reflects on a project implemented in two neighborhoods of two northern México cities, with the objective of mitigating crime and violence, while recovering public spaces in these communities. The project implemented a hybridized methodology, including Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED), attention to Youth at Risk, and the prevention of Gender Based Violence. All these were integrated transversally with a community participation approach incorporated throughout the project actions. This article reflects on the successes and failures of this pilot project, as demonstrated by differentiated results between a neighborhood located in Chihuahua City and another in themunicipality of Guadalupe, within Monterrey's Metro Area. The lessons learned, include the relevance of local political timing and interests, the importance of accurate and manageable geographic definitions for the areas of implementation, the role of NGOs, the importance of local educational institutions-in particular schools of architecture and the need for community oriented strategic consultants, to appropriately advise local governments in the implementation of projects of this nature. The article demonstrates the effort to make it accessible, and to anticipate the issues and opportunities as many Mexican, and other Latin American countries and cities engage in the spatial and social recovery of public spaces, neighborhoods, communities, and cities after years of high crime and violence. © 2019 by the author.

TI  - Building biodiversity in neighbourhood parks in Bangalore city, India: Ordinary yet essential
AU  - Swamy, S.
AU  - Nagendra, H.
AU  - Devy, S.
T2  - PLoS ONE
AB  - Cities comprise of mixed green patches that vary in size and are highly scattered and disconnected. Although small green spaces largely dominate the cityscape, they are often neglected and ignored by the naturalists and conservationists, as they do not fulfill the large green spaces criteria. The citizens on the other hand seem to have a different perception and requirements from small green spaces as they are within their neighbourhood. Bangalore, a developing city within South India, consists of a large number of newly formed residential areas which have pocket green spaces in the form of neighbourhood parks (henceforth NPs). They are maintained by the municipality and are mainly designed for recreation purposes, completely neglecting the fact that these spaces could be essential for biodiversity. Here, there is a disconnect between the requirements of the citizens, conservationists and the end product that the municipality delivers. Here, through a questionnaire survey we assess the biodiversity citizens are fond off, and use them as surrogate taxa for the not so immediately obvious taxa, insects to enumerate the biodiversity within NPs. We analyze and identify landscape characteristics around NPs which could enhance the biodiversity within NPs. Our results reveal that people are fond of Birds and Butterflies and we use them as surrogates for the inconspicuous taxa to assess biodiversity within NPs. 55 tree species, 45 species of birds, 41 species of butterflies and 68 morpho species of insects were recorded. We demonstrate that small green spaces are critical systems and help support biodiversity across three scale within the city. Interestingly, results suggests that density of NPs is more important rather than the size of NPs. Also, the presence of high density of NPs within a neighbourhood could support similar biodiversity that large green spaces support. Finally, this study provides insights on the landscape matrix that could help enhance biodiversity support service within NPs and the surrounding neighbourhood. © 2019 Swamy et al.

AU  - Stadlbauer, C.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - The Hexa-Hives illustrate how an outdoor live installation (landscaped garden installation) can serve as incentive for inter-species encounters and at the same time challenge the paradigm of conventional beekeeping. The Hexa-Hive is an experimental hive, designed to both host honeybees and serve as outdoor furniture for humans. Since 2012, the Hexa-Hive has been a semi-permanent installation in Kaisaniemi Botanic Garden of Helsinki. A further development, the Hexa-Hive Village was first installed at the campus of Aalto University, in Otaniemi, Finland in 2013. Launched as artistic intervention, the Hexa-Hive village became a landscaped area hosting honeybees and inviting people to hang out. In 2014, a further development - the installation “Hexa-Hive Village with Airstrip for Bees” - was exhibited as part of the art exhibition “Semi-Wild Gardens” at Kouvola city art museum and in 2016, the installation was placed in Tarja Halonen Park, a public area in the centre of Helsinki. The article explores the effects of the installation assessed via a questionnaire. The findings include the emergence of a “garden quality” around the “Hexa-Hive” the increase of local faunal and floral diversity and the notion of wilderness in the city. The concept of urban acupuncture and the mental and psychological value of public gardens for humans are described as features of the installation. The Hexa-Hive is part of Melliferopolis and was launched in Helsinki in 2012. The activities comprise exhibitions, workshops, installations and lectures. www.melliferopolis.net © 2016 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Neighbourhood green space in deprived urban communities: Issues and barriers to use
AU  - Gidlow, C.J.

T2  - Local Environment
AB  - This paper presents qualitative baseline data from a mixed methods evaluation of a 12-month project to promote use of a small neighbourhood park in a deprived urban community in North Staffordshire, UK. Focus groups were conducted with adults (n = 35) and young people (n = 23) to explore perceptions of local green space, implications for use and potential interventions. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes. Despite the expressed importance of living close to green space (i.e. doorstep green space), adults reported antisocial behaviour and a lack of facilities as principal barriers to use. Some common issues emerged from discussions with local youth, in addition to tensions and ownership issues over the space. Consequently, the park did not appear to serve the whole community as a recreation space and for some, represented a source of distress and conflict, rather than a resource to promote health and community well-being. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AU  - Nielson, C.

T2  - ITE Journal (Institute of Transportation Engineers)
AB  - Interim Design and Tactical Urbanism should be considered as tools to provide real world tests of designs in three-dimensions. As most Interim Design and Tactical Urbanism projects evolve from a more permanent, higher-cost design proposal, these tools can both test the community's long-term vision for a project and ensure that the community's needs are addressed in the near-term. Some Interim Designs will reduce or remove the clear recovery zone, which should be discussed with local engineers to ensure the modifications are appropriate to the context. Similarly, consideration must be given to the duration of a design. The City prepared full construction drawings for the Interim Design solution, consisting of a stamped set of striping and signing plans. They detailed the spacing and location of landscape planters, soft hit posts, colorized curb extensions, and other striping.

TI  - Between Boundaries: From Commoning and Guerrilla Gardening to Community Land Trust Development in Liverpool
AU  - Thompson, M.
T2  - Antipode
AB  - Emerging in the cracks of the ownership model are alternatives to state/market provision of affordable housing and public/private-led regeneration of declining urban neighbourhoods, centred on commoning and collective dweller control. This paper explores how the community land trust model can become an effective institutional solution to urban decline in the context of private property relations. It explores a case study of a CLT campaign in Granby, a particularly deprived inner-city neighbourhood in Liverpool, England. The campaign seeks to collectively acquire empty homes under conditions of austerity, which have opened up the space for grassroots experimentation with guerrilla gardening, proving important for the campaign in gaining political trust and financial support. This paper discusses the potential of the CLT model as a vehicle for democratic stewardship of place and unpacks the contradictions threatening to undermine its political legitimacy. © 2015 Antipode Foundation Ltd.

AB  - Interim design, developed by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), is part of the planning outreach process that informs a final design. It can serve as a bridge to the community, helping to build support for a project and test its functionality before going into construction. The growing popularity of both interim design and tactical urbanism makes for exciting times, with potential for real and inclusive community collaboration and innovation. By embracing the benefits of interim design and tactical urbanism, while actively grappling with their challenges, ITE members can serve the public and contribute professional knowledge to an emerging area of practice.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the association between adult individuals' body mass index (BMI) and characteristics of parks (size and cleanliness) in an urban environment taking into account the physical and social environments of the neighborhood. Methods: Cross-sectional, hierarchical linear models were used to determine whether park effects were associated with BMI using self-reported height and weight data obtained from the Community Health Survey in New York City (2002-2006). Results: Both the proportion of the residential zip code that was large park space and the proportion that was small park space had significant inverse associations with BMI after controlling for individual socio-demographic and zip code built environment characteristics (-. 0.20 BMI units across the inter-quartile range (IQR) for large parks, 95% CI -. 0.32, -. 0.08; -. 0.21 BMI units across the IQR for small parks, 95% CI -. 0.31, -. 0.10, respectively). Poorer scores on the park cleanliness index were associated with higher BMI, 0.18 BMI units across the IQR of the park cleanliness index (95% CI 0.05, 0.30). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that proportion of neighborhoods that was large or small park space and park cleanliness were associated with lower BMI among NYC adults after adjusting for other neighborhood features such as homicides and walkability, characteristics that could influence park usage. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Active and dynamic management of biodiversity is of utmost importance in the face of increasing human pressures on nature. Current approaches for site selection of protected areas often assume that both conservation features and management actions are fixed in space and time. However, this approach should be revised to allow for spatio-temporal shifts of biodiversity features, threats and management options. Our aim here was to demonstrate a novel approach for systematic conservation planning at a fine scale that incorporates dynamic ecological processes (e.g., succession), biodiversity targets and management costs. We used the new 'Marxan with Zones' decision support tool to spatially redistribute the major structural types of vegetation within a privately-owned nature park in Israel and facilitate the achievement of multiple conservation targets for minimum cost. The park is located in the Mediterranean climate region of the eastern Mediterranean Basin, one of Earth's richest biodiversity hotspots. This small park alone (4.5km2) holds 660 species of native plants and six structural types of vegetation. The region has been subject to manifold human pressures such as grazing, clearing and fire for millennia and is currently threatened by a range of modern human-related activities (e.g., invasive alien species). By spatially redistributing the six structural vegetation types under three scenarios, representing different conservation objectives (no change, equal distribution - evenness of structural types, preference to early succession stages) within three budget frameworks, we identified a set of near-optimal conservation strategies that can be enacted over time. The current spatial distribution of structural types and the cost of changing one structural type into another via management actions had a major impact on the spatial prioritization outcomes and management recommendations. Notably, an advanced successional stage (dense Mediterranean garrigue) tended to dominate a large portion of the landscape when the available budgets were low because it is a relatively inexpensive structural type to maintain. The approach presented here can be further applied to spatially prioritize conservation goals in the face of shifting environments and climates, allowing dynamic conservation planning at multiple spatial scales. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Urban street greenery as a prevention against illegal dumping of household garbage-A case in Suwon, South Korea
AU  - Joo, Y.
AU  - Kwon, Y.
T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - While greenery in the city provide a number of important functions, the prevention of illegal dumping of household garbage (IDHG) has rarely been mentioned. Literature review on IDHG implied that greening on dumping sites can be understood as an effort to prevent such behaviour by modifying the physical characteristics of the site, in which case the physical characteristics of the greenery itself (i.e. the physical design) is also a potential factor. Therefore, this exploratory study attempts to answer (1) whether urban street greenery can function as a prevention against IDHG and (2) what relationship exists between the physical design elements of street greenery and its effectiveness. The study examined a recent IDHG-preventive greening project implemented in Suwon, a South Korean city. A quasi-experiment comparing the street greenery sites with non-street greenery sites and a binary logistic regression among the street greenery sites was conducted respectively to analyse the above questions. Results suggest that while street greenery does appear to function as a preventive method against IDHG, certain physical design elements notably related to the greenery's spatial features also tend to influence its effectiveness. A possible explanation may be that these elements might contribute to its effectiveness by reducing the actual space available for dumping garbage. It is hoped that this exploratory study could provide insight and universal implications regarding the relationship among urban greenery, its physical design, and its function as a prevention against IDHG. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

T2  - Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences
AB  - One of the major threats facing protected areas (PAs) is land-use change and habitat loss. We assessed the impact of land-use change on PAs. The majority of parks have been effective at protecting the ecosystems within their borders, even in areas with significant land-use pressures. More in particular, the capacity of PAs to slow down habitat degradation and to favour habitat restoration is clearly related to their size, with smaller areas that on average follow the dominant land-use change pattern into which they are embedded. Our results suggest that small parks are not going to be viable in the long term if they are considered as islands surrounded by a 'human-dominated ocean'. However, small PAs are, in many cases, the only option available, implying that we need to devote much more attention to the non-protected matrix in which PAs must survive. © 2008 The Royal Society.

TI  - Regional analysis and calibration for the South of Portugal of a simple evapotranspiration model for use in an autonomous landscape irrigation controller
AU  - Teixeira, J.
AU  - Shahidian, S.
AU  - Rolim, J.
T2  - WSEAS Transactions on Environment and Development
AB  - This work is part of the development of an automatic and autonomous landscape irrigation controller which uses a simpler method for computing ETo than the FAO Penman-Monteith method (FAO-PM) in order to reduce the number of sensors required and lower the system cost. It is also intended to select a simple equation, since one of the requirements of this controller is that it should use an ETo formula with a reduced number of programming instructions due to its limited capacity. The controller to be developed should be autonomous and inexpensive, enabling it to be installed in small green areas such as small parks and gardens, having as main users the municipalities. Thus a regional analysis was made about the suitability of 6 methods for computing reference evapotranspiration (Hargreaves, Hargreaves-Samani, Jensen-Haise, Makkink, Priestley-Taylor and Turc) based only on the weather parameters temperature and solar radiation in the Alentejo. For this analysis a network of automatic weather stations was used, providing the meteorological data with a daily time-step for the period from 2003 to 2007. Results show that after the calibration, for each station, these methods present a good correlation with the ETo values calculated by the FAO-PM method. The best results were obtained by the Jensen-Haise method, and the worst results were computed by the Priestley-Taylor, Makkink, and Hargreaves-Samani methods. A considerable variation exists in the adjustment parameters from one weather station to another, so one can not use a single set of medium parameters to calibrate these functions for the entire region. Thus, it can be concluded that the Jensen-Haise is the best method for the Alentejo conditions, and it should be calibrated for each meteorological station. The results obtained by the Hargreaves-Samani method, based only on temperatures, are similar to other 5 methods and is the only one that does not need calibration, which indicates that this method can be considered for the elimination of the radiation sensor.

TI  - Can a small park preserve its flora? A historical study of Bic National Park, Quebec
AU  - Lavoie, C.
AU  - Saint-Louis, A.
T2  - Botany
AB  - We reconstructed the 100 year history of the botanical composition of a small (19 km2) park (Bic National Park, Bic/St. Fabien, Quebec) located within an agricultural landscape. Using 64 historical sources and a botanical field survey, we documented changes in the native and exotic vascular flora that occurred before and after the creation of the park in 1984. We evaluated how many native species were lost from 1984 to 2005, and the number of exotic species that became established during the same period. A total of 585 plant taxa were found in Bic National Park before its creation, of which 488 (83%) were native. The park harbours more taxa today (710) than in the past, but the proportion of exotic taxa has increased significantly (from 16% to 25%) since 1984. Despite its small area, Bic National Park has very successfully preserved its flora during its 21 year history. Thirteen species have likely been extirpated from the area occupied by the park. However, 12 of these 13 species have not been seen since at least 1957, so they were probably extirpated before the creation of the park. On the other hand, the creation of the park did not stop the introduction of exotic species. Land-use changes, an increase in the number of visitors, and horticultural plantings are probably the main causes explaining the rise in the number of exotic taxa observed during the last 21 years. A small park located far from urban centres may preserve its flora, but is not necessarily a bastion against exotic species. © 2008 NRC.

T2  - Wildfowl
AB  - Unlike most wild goose populations in the Western Palaearctic, the feral Greylag Geese Anser anser in Stuttgart, southwest Germany, are not known to migrate. In winter 2004/05, a study was carried out to determine how this resident group copes with snow and ice, since severe weather conditions are not unusual in the region. Changes in activity budgets, feeding behaviour and abdominal fat reserves were investigated. From January to March 2005, frequent snowfall resulted in persistent snow cover. In response to the resulting lack of food, the geese changed their daily feeding patterns, fed less, loafed more and subsequently lost abdominal fat reserves. Although they moved from small park lakes to the ice-free river for roosting, they did not leave the area in search of snow-free feeding sites. © Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust.

TI  - Guerrilla gardening
AU  - Johnson, L.
T2  - Alternatives Journal
AB  - Guerrilla gardening is a regenerative act of planting, an unsanctioned, secret act that leaves no traces on the landscape. Such random action does not guarantee success. A thousand unknown threats lurk, but what is guaranteed is the thought of seeing the landscape in an entirely new way. To intervene, however, on property that is not one's own is one of the ultimate transgressive acts in a social system based on private ownership. Certainly, this type of gardening is illegal. However, guerrilla gardeners are not interested in taking over spaces that are already nurtured. They set their sights on the unloved and uncared corners of the cityscape which are neglected. Instead of waiting, guerrilla gardeners take matters into their own creative hands.

AU  - Giridharan, R.

AU  - Ganesan, S.
AU  - Givoni, B.
T2  - Building and Environment
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of on-site variables on the influence of vegetation in lowering outdoor temperature. The study uses six critical on-site variables such as surface albedo, sky view factor, altitude, shrub cover, tree cover and average height to floor area ratio to carry out analysis in five data sets. The climatic parameters and physical characteristics were measured and surveyed, respectively in 216 stations in high-rise high-density residential developments of coastal Hong Kong. The data set is mainly categorised into peak summer clear sky days (PSCS-days), peak summer partially cloudy days (PSPC-days) and late summer days to address the issues related to cloudy sky conditions in Hong Kong. The trend analysis shows that at a lower sky view factor, ranging from 0.1 to 0.25, shrub cover as low as 10-15% in a 1000 m2 open area is more effective in reducing outdoor temperature than the same level of tree cover in a location with a higher sky view factor (0.4 or above). The regression models used in this study were able to explain the influence of on-site variables on vegetation in lowering the outdoor temperature within the respective urban settings. In high-rise high-density environments, on-site variables such as sky view factor and altitude have a substantial impact on the influence of vegetation in lowering outdoor temperature. However, off-site variables such as high urban density and anthropogenic heat could negate the behaviour of sky view factor and altitude. The study suggests that increasing the tree cover from 25% to 40% in the pocket parks in coastal area residential developments of Hong Kong could reduce daytime urban heat island intensity (UHI) by further 0.5 °C. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - We own the city :Tactical urbanism projects are popping up nationwide
AU  - Zimmerman, M.
T2  - Planning
AB  - Tactical urbanism is a movement that is owned by no one and can involve anyone. A key motivation is to slice through the red tape of the conventional planning and building process. It is about getting the basic elements on the ground quickly and cheaply, even if at times doing so goes outside the system. Tactical urbanism interventions can legitimately occur anywhere along what Lydon calls a tactical spectrum. Like many U.S. cities, Memphis has been plagued for decades by neighborhood disinvestment, suburban flight, and dwindling city revenues. Sanctioned interventions are often driven by the public sector but use the same implementation techniques.

TI  - Effect of forest harvest on the vegetation of an urban park
AU  - Tessier, J.T.
T2  - Northeastern Naturalist
AB  - Forested parks are an urban oasis, and forest management plays an important part in their maintenance. I used a systematic sampling technique to quantify the vegetation and propagule bank in a small urban park prior to and following a forest management event. The number of non-forest species and the abundance of Toxicodendron radicans (Poison Ivy) increased after forest harvest. Distance from an edge did not affect the change in vegetation. In the propagule bank, loss of basal area in a plot was positively correlated with an increase in the percent of species that were non-forest and non-native. The Sørenson coefficient of community similarity comparing the species composition of the vegetation before and after harvest was 0.769 (out of 1.0), but that for the propagule bank was 0.308. Forest management practices in small urban parks should be designed with extreme caution due to the volatile settings of these refuges.

TI  - “Poverty” and the politics of syncopation: Urban examples from Kinshasa (DR Congo)
AU  - De Boeck, F.
T2  - Current Anthropology
AB  - By means of an ethnographic “urban acupuncture” of a specific building within the city of Kinshasa, this article explores how poverty effects emerging publics in the city. Poverty “rhythms” city life in specific ways, and these rhythms may be best understood in terms of a politics of the syncopated and the suspended through which urban publics are constantly splintered and reassembled. The suspensions and missed beats that thus punctuate urban daily living often produce violence, closure, and isolation, but simultaneously they also generate unexpected accents that form openings into the “something else” of the offbeat track, thereby hinting at the (always vulnerable and equally problematic) possibility of alternative collective action and the ad hoc creation of new groups, publics, and public spaces. © 2015 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

T2  - Ecological Applications
AB  - Identifying the rates of recovery of fish in no-take areas is fundamental to designing protected area networks, managing fisheries, estimating yields, identifying ecological interactions, and informing stakeholders about the outcomes of this management. Here we study the recovery of coral reef fishes through 37 years of protection using a space-for-time chronosequence of four marine national parks in Kenya. Using AIC model selection techniques, we assessed recovery trends using five ecologically meaningful production models: asymptotic, Ricker, logistic, linear, and exponential. There were clear recovery trends with time for species richness, total and size class density, and wet masses at the level of the taxonomic family. Species richness recovered rapidly to an asymptote at 10 years. The two main herbivorous families displayed differing responses to protection, scarids recovering rapidly, but then exhibiting some decline while acanthurids recovered more slowly and steadily throughout the study. Recovery of the two invertebrate-eating groups suggested competitive interactions over resources, with the labrids recovering more rapidly before a decline and the balistids demonstrating a slower logistic recovery. Remaining families displayed differing trends with time, with a general pattern of decline in smaller size classes or small-bodied species after an initial recovery, which suggests that some species- and size-related competitive and predatory control occurs in older closures. There appears to be an ecological succession of dominance with an initial rapid rise in labrids and scarids, followed by a slower rise in balistids and acanthurids, an associated decline in sea urchins, and an ultimate dominance in calcifying algae. Our results indicate that the unfished "equilibrium" biomass of the fish assemblage >10 cm is 1100-1200 kg/ha, but these small parks (<10 km 2) are likely to underestimate pre-human influence values due to edge effects and the rarity of taxa with large area requirement, such as apex predators, including sharks. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - This paper considers an emerging planning practice that uses networked connections to interact with urban places and re-create enlivened cities. The paper presents “urban acupuncture” as a new planning approach that broadens communication and strategically targets interventions across the city. Defined as an approach, which, through the use of digital social networks and interactions, involves citizens and planners in place activations in order to stimulate and reinvigorate place, thus creating meaningful relationships between citizens and their urban settings. This paper uses the UR[BNE] Brisbane Festival 2012 as a qualitative case study of urban acupuncture, best defined as a hyper-localized healing treatment through place activation to enliven and recreate cities. It examines the challenges faced and opportunities embraced by a network of urban professionals. Their aim was to activate the underused urban spaces of central Brisbane through the festival's activities and events. The findings identify the key elements required to design public spaces using socially and technologically networked interactions. © 2015 The Society of Urban Technology.

TI  - Social Media Use as Urban Acupuncture for Empowering Socially Challenged Communities
AU  - Messeter, J.
T2  - Journal of Urban Technology
AB  - This paper explores potential roles of social media in community empowerment, based on a study of a non-profit NGO in a socially challenged suburb of Cape Town, South Africa. In particular, it focuses on the relation between online and offline behavior, and how the use of social media can counteract negative influences in the community, e.g., drug abuse and gangsterism. Interviews with staff and participants reveal that using social media in a socially challenged community results in different social media use and different connections between online and offline activities than earlier social-media research reported. These differences may inform design and social innovation for disruptive interaction to address negative influences, such as drugs and gangsterism, in socially challenged communities. © 2015 The Society of Urban Technology.

AB  - A small urban park in Yerevan, Armenia, was studied using biogechemical analysis of the tree canopy, field spectral reflectance measurements of tree leaves, simulated WorldView-2 multispectral data generated from the leaf spectra, and two summer images of real WorldView-2 data. The tree canopy of the park is dominated by two trees, Robinia pseudoacacia L. (locust) and Fraxinus excelsior L. (ash). The Highest values of lead, nickel, molybdenum, copper and zinc were found in leaves harvested from trees adjacent to the streets, whereas most of the lowest values for those metals were found in the interior of the park. A t-test of the field spectral measurements indicated that the green and red edge spectral reflectance of leaves from trees near the streets was significantly higher than that of leaves of trees in the interior (p < 0.05). However, in simulated WorldView-2 multispectral data, the street and interior leaves were only statistically separable in band 6 (Red Edge) raw data and hyperspherical direction cosine (HSDC) normalized band 6 data. HSDC-normalized band 6 digital numbers from realWorldView-2 data of 16 June and 9 August 2011 from trees adjacent to the streets were statistically higher than the interior locations for both dates.Maps of anomalously high HSDC-normalized band 6 values show a concentration on the park edges, suggesting vehicle pollution may indeed be the cause of the observed patterns. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Vacant land is a significant economic problem for many cities, but also may affect the health and safety of residents. In order for community-based solutions to vacant land to be accepted by target populations, community members should be engaged in identifying local health impacts and generating solutions. We conducted 50 in-depth semi-structured interviews with people living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a city with high vacancy, about the impact of vacant land on community and individual health and safety, as well as ideas for solutions to vacant land. Participants described a neighborhood physical environment dominated by decaying abandoned homes and overgrown vacant lots which affected community well-being, physical health, and mental health. Vacant land was thought to affect community well-being by overshadowing positive aspects of the community, contributing to fractures between neighbors, attracting crime, and making residents fearful. Vacant land was described as impacting physical health through injury, the buildup of trash, and attraction of rodents, as well as mental health through anxiety and stigma. Participants had several ideas for solutions to vacant land in their community, including transformation of vacant lots into small park spaces for the elderly and playgrounds for youth, and the use of abandoned homes for subsidized housing and homeless shelters. A few participants took pride in maintaining vacant lots on their block, and others expressed interest in performing maintenance but lacked the resources to do so. Public health researchers and practitioners, and urban planners should engage local residents in the design and implementation of vacant land strategies. Furthermore, municipalities should ensure that the health and safety impact of vacant land helps drive policy decisions around vacant land. © 2012 The New York Academy of Medicine.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Though landscape vegetation in cities is human-mediated and often more diverse than that in surrounding environments, little work has been done to quantify ways that humans shape its composition. Our study identified important sources of variation in perennial vegetation composition within residential neighborhoods of Phoenix, AZ, USA. We hypothesized that neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) should offer some capacity for predicting landscape vegetation richness and abundance in both residential neighborhoods and embedded small city parks. As predicted, neighborhood vegetation richness increased across a gradient of low to high SES (R2=0.89) with the most variation explained by median family income (R2=0.86). In contrast, neighborhood vegetation abundance decreased across a gradient of increased time since disturbance (R2=0.62) with the most variation explained by median year of neighborhood development (R2=0.56). Median year of neighborhood development was also the dominant factor (R2=0.47) in explaining decreased park vegetation abundance across a gradient of increased time since disturbance. We were least able to predict park vegetation richness and could account for only 29% of variation using a SES gradient model with percent of population having a graduate education as the most dominant factor. In residential neighborhoods, we identified more than 3 times the number of landscape vegetation taxa than an earlier report and also found a higher percentage of native vegetation in parks than in surrounding neighborhoods. We discuss these different compositional patterns of perennial vegetation in neighborhoods and embedded parks in terms of their relationship to socioeconomic and disturbance gradients, and a conceptual framework of "top-down" and "bottom-up" human management influences. Our study intimates that residential vegetation composition in rapidly expanding, arid cities like Phoenix is largely driven by "luxury" and legacy effects and should be most rich in neighborhoods with the highest socioeconomic standing and most abundant in newest neighborhoods. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban parks and green spaces support a wide array of species and play an important role in long-term sustainability. This study analyzed the needs and attitudes of citizens towards urban parks and green spaces in order to provide information for setting the future direction of urban sustainability to maximize quality of life. A questionnaire survey was conducted to analyze the general characteristics of respondents and their awareness of parks and spaces. First, the results indicate that the main purpose of visiting parks was relaxation and walking. Second, the type of parks visited most frequently by the respondents was pocket parks around home. Third, the main reason for going to the frequently visited parks was "close to home". Fourth, the major reason for visiting parks infrequently was "improper park management". Fifth, the desired types of urban parks were relaxation parks close to natural rivers. Sixth, citizens wanted to participate in the expansion projects of parks and green spaces through non-profit civic organizations or volunteer activities. Further research with a comparative analysis among different cities will be necessary to generalize Korean attitudes to urban parks and green spaces for urban sustainability. © 2015 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - The impact of small-scale design interventions on the behaviour patterns of the users of an urban wasteland
AU  - Unt, A.-L.
AU  - Bell, S.
T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - Urban derelict space can form a valuable complementary element to the formal green spaces of a city: wastelands are often biologically diverse and their unregulated status can provoke innovative spatial activities by a wide range of users. Using the case of an urban brownfield in Tallinn, Estonia, this paper examines how such a space is used and evaluates the magnitude of the impact of minor design interventions - so-called urban acupuncture - on the activities carried out by the users. The study used field observations and behaviour mapping to compare the spatial pattern of the users before and after small design interventions. Although there was widespread use beforehand there was both an increase in use and a different pattern afterwards, which was clearly detectable from the composite behaviour maps of both arrangements, where users follow the properties of the particular environment. The small improvements tested showed the largest effect on the female and the older user groups, raising the number of overall visits and increasing the occurrence of active behaviour almost five times. The research demonstrates that small, inexpensive and possibly temporary interventions can have a major positive effect. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Quantitative methods of measuring restorative components in urban public parks
AU  - Nordh, H.
T2  - Journal of Landscape Architecture
AB  - The paper demonstrates how quantitative methods can be used in a landscape architecture study. Three different methods to determine how people evaluate the psychological restoration/relaxation potential of small urban parks, as described in attention restoration theory, were assessed. The methods presented and evaluated are: ratings of environments based on quantified photos, eye tracking and choice-based conjoint analysis. Ratings of environments based on quantified photos allow regression analysis to assess the environmental components that individually predict the outcome, in this case restoration likelihood. Eye tracking provides objective data on which environmental components people look at when assessing the landscape. Conjoint analysis enables determination of those components and levels of components that are most important to people in a choice situation. Conjoint analysis is based on textual rather than visual stimuli. As illustrated by the results from each method, the quantitative approach provides potentially useful information to researchers and professionals in landscape architecture.

TI  - The value of water-related amenities in an arid city: The case of the Phoenix metropolitan area
AU  - Larson, E.K.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - In the arid metropolitan area of Phoenix, AZ, water resources play a vital role in maintaining and enhancing the urban ecosystem. There are several examples of " luxury" uses of water to create amenities not common to desert ecosystems: reduced temperatures, artificial lakes, golf courses, and abundant vegetation. In this study our goal was to appraise the relative value of these water-related amenities for urban residents. We correlated spatially explicit housing sales data from the Maricopa County Assessor's Office with environmental and locational data provided by the Central Arizona - Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research project to construct hedonic models at the regional and local scales to estimate the marginal willingness to pay for amenities associated with intensive water use. Our results revealed the preferences of homeowners for lowered temperatures, and vegetation abundance, however we found proximity to small parks to be generally considered a disamenity despite their frequent landscape design of grass, trees, and artificial lakes. At the local level of analysis, our analyses found examples where one attribute (e.g., plant richness) is considered an amenity in one place, but a disamenity in another, suggesting that there may be several markets in the metropolitan region. Because climate change models predict the US Southwest to become hotter and drier, evaluation of the importance of these water-dependent luxury amenities will be vital for future planning. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Pocket parks for people - A study of park design and use
AU  - Nordh, H.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - The present study focuses on small urban public parks, specifically on how they should be designed to promote a potential for psychological restoration and on what activities people could imagine doing in such parks. Students from Oslo University College were presented with visual stimuli depicting 74 small urban parks. They were asked to assess how likely it was that they could rest and recover in the parks presented in the photos. In addition, the participants were asked to write down what park components contributed to high versus low ratings on restoration likelihood, and what types of activities they could imagine doing in the parks presented in the photos. The components and activities the participants mentioned were grouped into categories describing similar properties. The categories mentioned most frequently and giving high ratings on restoration likelihood represented natural categories such as: 'a lot of grass', 'a lot of flowers/plants' and 'water features'. In contrast, the categories contributing to low ratings on restoration likelihood represented lack of vegetation or disturbance from the surroundings such as: 'a lot of hard surfaces', 'a lot of traffic' and 'poorly shielded from the surroundings'. The activities mentioned as being typically performed in the types of parks presented in the photos were 'relax and philosophize', 'read' and 'eat/drink'. Conclusions drawn from the study: Small urban parks should be designed with natural components, shielded from disturbing surroundings and furnished with some seating to promote opportunities for restorative experiences and to function as social meeting places. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - The relationships between net primary productivity, human population density and species conservation
AU  - Luck, G.W.
T2  - Journal of Biogeography
AB  - Aim: In this study, I determine the relationships between net primary productivity (NPP), human population density, species richness and land use. I also examine the implications of human settlement patterns for species conservation. Location: Australia. Methods: I document the associations between NPP, human population density and the species richness of birds, butterflies and mammals using correlations and spatial regressions. I also assess changes in land-use with NPP and population density, focussing particularly on protected areas. An initial exploration into the implications of the NPP-population density relationship for regional conservation strategies is provided. Results: Human population density increases with NPP suggesting that available energy may be a key driving force of human settlement patterns. The species richness of each taxonomic group and geographically restricted species also increases with NPP leading to substantial overlap between species diversity and populated regions. The percentage of land designated as minimal use decreases considerably with increasing human population density and NPP, while intensive agriculture is confined entirely to areas of high NPP. There are strong negative relationships between the size of Australia's National Parks and human population density and NPP. Small parks are often surrounded by relatively dense settlements, but have high average NPP, while large parks are mostly isolated and characterized by low productivity. There are no areas in the highest quartile of NPP that also occur in the most sparsely populated regions, presenting challenges for conservation strategies wanting to protect productive areas under the least threat of human development. Main conclusions: Human population density and species richness respond similarly to variation in NPP, leading to spatial congruence between human settlements and productive, species rich regions. Planning strategies are required that minimize the potential threat posed by human development to diverse ecosystems and maximize the underlying productivity of protected areas. Reducing the level of threat may require stabilizing the size of the human population, while capturing larger areas of relatively high productivity in the conservation reserve system would lead to greater protection of local diversity. © 2007 The Author.

AB  - Migrating birds congregate near the shores of Lake Erie during migration and may be funneled through small green spaces within the urban matrix of Great Lake coastal cities, where they are at risk of higher mortality from manmade structures. Bird deaths due to window collisions were assessed amongst a complex oflow-rise buildings (<30 m) on a university campus in Cleveland, OH. A 1.8 km route was surveyed three times per week during a 12-month period. Deaths were tested against null hypotheses that season, taxonomy, and building attributes had no significant relationship with avian mortality. We recovered 271 dead birds of 50 species, all of which were consistent with regional bird lists and Neotropical-Nearctic and North American migrants through Ohio. Deaths occurred non-randomly by week, month, and migratory status with 90 percent of deaths occurring during spring and fall migrations. Consequently, migrants (warblers: 34 percent of species richness, 30 percent of deaths; sparrows: 14 percent of richness, 35 percent of deaths) were observed nine times more frequently than residents. Neotropical-Nearctic migrant species outnumbered North American migrant species. Although there was no statistical difference between the compass direction of a building facade and the number of deaths, deaths were not randomly distributed among campus buildings. Rather, significantly more deaths occurred at facades with higher percentages of glass. The presence of trees within 5 m of a window and the reflection of trees in windows were also associated with a greater risk of fatality. A better understanding of the factors associated with birdwindow collisions is a pressing issue in the conservation of migratory birds.

AB  - We investigate whether public park amenities act as a substitute for outdoor water use by single-family residential (SFR) households in semi-arid Tucson, AZ, USA. Specifically we account for the effects of a park's proximity, size, and greenness (measured by NDVI), as well as the presence of a public swimming pool. SFR households with and without home pools are analyzed separately. We control for SFR property attributes, including house size, age, yard size and property NDVI. Results suggest that SFR outdoor water use is influenced by the conditions of all parks within an 8. km (5. mile) street distance. We also find significant differences between the "with" and "without" home pool groups. Households with pools used more outdoor water per square meter of house, per year of house age and per unit of NDVI. Households without pools appeared to reduce outdoor use in response to nearby small parks and increased park NDVI. "With pool" households had the opposite response: they appeared to increase outdoor water use in response to these variables. However, "with pool" households did reduce their outdoor water use in response to nearby public pools. Medium and large parks were associated with increased outdoor water use for both groups. We conclude that public green space and pools can substitute for private versions of these amenities, and if well designed, can contribute to water demand management and urban sustainability. This may be an avenue for addressing water supply shortages in semi-arid cities and other areas where populations are growing but water supplies are finite. © 2014.

TI  - Environmental affordances: A practical approach for design of nearby outdoor settings in urban residential areas
AU  - Hadavi, S.

AU  - Hunter, M.C.R.
T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - While daily contact with nature is essential in large cities, such opportunities are often limited, thus reducing chances for psychological restoration. Even if available, however, such places will not be used if they fail to meet residents' needs and preferences. This study focuses on the preferred qualities of nearby nature in terms of both environmental affordances and design characteristics in urban neighborhoods. The study was conducted in the Logan Square Neighborhood in Chicago, IL, and involved 53 individuals. The research instrument was a set of 93 photos arranged in columns, depicting a variety of commonly used landscape design elements and urban outdoor scenes. Participants selected their preferred scenes and grouped them based on what they considered meaningful. The findings offer evidence of participants' preference for small green spaces that provide opportunities for both socializing and growing plants. This study illuminates interconnections between environmental affordances and green space design attributes that address participants' concerns and expectations. It uncovers the importance of environmental affordances in green space preference studies, a topic that is largely missing from existing work on landscape preference. Further, it showcases a novel method-the use of participant-generated photo grouping to better understand the basis of preferences. The method emerged from pragmatic application of the Environmental Affordances Theory from Environmental Psychology to the landscape planning and design process. Finally, the results were used to create a set of useful recommendations to help urban planners and designers create more livable spaces in dense urban areas. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Taipei park: Signs of occupation
AU  - Allen, J.R.
T2  - Journal of Asian Studies
AB  - This essay investigates the configuration of public space in Taipei City using the example of a small urban park. In particular, this essay considers how that space functioned and functions as a. site for "occupation" - that is, when and how the public space was produced by, brought under the control of, or performed in by a specific cultural agent, whether a colonial government or skateboarder. Those occupations delineate and transform the space for purposes ranging from the official, macro, and long-lived to the subversive, partial, and fleeting. The park is a shifting pastiche of different moments of occupation, diachronically and contemporaneously layered, existing in a tissue of accommodation and anxiety. The primary focus here is the evolution of the park in the urban plans of the early Japanese colonial, government; however, comparisons to both the pre- and postcolonial periods are made, and the contemporary conditions of the park are considered as well. © 2007 Association of Asian Studies Inc.

TI  - Critical urban gardening as a post-environmentalist practice
AU  - Certomà, C.
T2  - Local Environment
AB  - This paper investigates the emergence of the urban gardening movement as a form of post-environmentalist political practice. Despite the general acknowledgment of the relevance of environmental issues in the contemporary world, according to Post-Environmentalism, environmental thinking is becoming increasingly "de-politicised". The aim of the paper is to suggest that "re-politicisation" of environmental politics is possible, taking into account the political practices emerging in urban space. The attachment to place materiality can, by means of common practices, make evident forgotten or ignored environmental relations; and it can make them a "public issue". These kinds of practices relay upon the association of humans and non-humans, as crucial actors in the political constitution of urban space. For instance, critical urban gardening practice may oppose the mainstream of environmental politics; it implies the use of biological material as a form of political expression, and activates material-semiotic networks existing in the urban environment. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Assessing restorative components of small urban parks using conjoint methodology
AU  - Nordh, H.

T2  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
AB  - Many studies have supported the proposition that natural environments contribute positively to psychological restoration. Less attention has been given to the relative importance of the physical environmental components that contribute to the restorative potential of such environments. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relative importance of environmental components, in small urban parks, for people looking for somewhere to sit down and rest. To address this aim, we used choice-based conjoint analysis, coupled with hierarchical Bayes estimation, to assess the utilities assigned to grass, bushes, trees, flower beds, water features, and the number of other people in the park. Via a web-based questionnaire, adult residents of Oslo, Norway (N= 154) were presented with text describing successive pairs of park alternatives. Each alternative was comprised of a set of environmental components at different levels. The respondents were to choose the preferred alternative in each pair, given that they were fatigued and looking for a place to rest for a little while. The amounts of grass, trees and other people had the most influence on their choices among park alternatives. Responses across groups defined by age, gender and earlier experience with parks and nature were relatively homogenous. From a planning perspective, the findings indicate the importance of focusing on structural components such as grass and trees rather than decorative components such as flowers and water features. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The economic impacts of parks on adjacent property values have been extensively studied in the literature. Studies on how individual park facilities influence property values, however, are rarely found. While park facilities are essential for providing diverse recreational opportunities, their economic impacts should also be considered when designing a park system. This study, therefore, applied hedonic regression models to examine the impacts of park facilities on neighboring residential property values within the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The park facilities examined are divided into two categories: passive (i.e. passive recreation space, water features, and gardens) and active (i.e. children's play grounds, ball fields, tennis courts, skate park, etc.). Analysis of results suggests that park facilities for passive recreation, with the exception of urban gardens, are likely to have positive impacts on property values. Active facilities, especially skate parks and children's play areas, tend to introduce negative impacts. The impacts of facilities on property values decrease over distance zones from parks, which is consistent with the findings in the literature. Moreover, the impacts of facilities on property values vary with size, as gardens and most active facilities are more likely to be beneficial in small parks, while water features in large parks tend to increase property values. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Imagined communities and othering processes: The discursive strategies of established Italian residents in a Milan city neighbourhood
AU  - Marzorati, R.
T2  - Journal of Language and Politics
AB  - The article explores discourses, which, strongly marked by the association between immigration and security/safety issues, shape conflicts between groups in the urban spaces. More specifically, the article analyses daily interactions in a neighbourhood located in a semi-central area of the city of Milan and the discursive strategies of established Italian residents in dealing with neighbours, shopkeepers and public space users of immigrant origin. It focuses on the specific case of a small park which, claimed by the Italian residents in the neighbourhood, is currently a space of different activities by different groups and constitutes a core of an intergroup conflict. Referring to the existent Italian literature on the social construction of immigration as a problem related to security and urban safety issues, the article focuses on how such a discourse is produced and reproduced at the local level in established residents' discourses and practices and their imagination/s of the community of 'us'. While the article analyses how established residents account for the changes that have occurred in their area, discursive strategies about the nature of the place and its 'legitimate' users as well as social practices of appropriation and control are examined in order to show the interrelation between the processes of othering and place-identity making. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

AU  - Gamez, J.L.S.

T2  - Journal of Urbanism
AB  - Self-made urbanity is not a new phenomenon. However, decades of economic restructuring and a neoliberalization of the city and state have made the public realm vulnerable to changes in the economic winds. Increasingly, such an environment poses limits to what can be done via formal planning and urban design processes while do-it-yourself (DIY) activities challenge basic assumptions of who and how spaces may be produced. We (the authors) have recognized this challenge and have worked to bring this awareness into our classroom. Through this paper, we illustrate how DIY approaches have been integrated into our interdisciplinary course, the Community Planning Workshop. We describe how the classroom environment can foster an appreciation for DIY approaches, how DIY practices bring the social and the physical into focus, and how grassroots’ strategies have transformational impacts upon students and their understanding of the roles of design and planning professions. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

T2  - Journal of Architectural and Planning Research
AB  - World expositions (expos) are spectacles and visual celebrations of human advances. Frequently termed fun expos or amusement parks by critics, the architecture and urban spaces created for such events are rarely discussed in the academic world, even though they have played an increasingly important role in expos since 1970. Hundreds of thousands of visitors are attracted to the expo sites each day, and they need to be given adequate public space for relaxation and socializing. In fact, expo sites are often more crowded than some of our densest cities and should be treated as genuine towns with very high population densities. In this article, public-space planning is referenced to traditional European town planning and contemporary development in high-density Asian cities. The former emphasizes streets and squares as the essential elements for various public social activities, while the latter use different strategies, such as multifaceted pedestrian systems, pocket parks, and sequential public spaces. The expo public spaces, particularly the giant roofed areas, work together to integrate traditional elements into high-density situations. In this paper, we illustrate how technology and public-space planning strategies were merged and adapted to create the breathtaking, multifunctional central sheltered spaces for three expos: Osaka, Hannover, and Shanghai. Through this illustration, we hope to provide useful lessons for effective public-space design, not only for future world events but also for high-density cities.

AU  - Adams, D.

T2  - Geografiska Annaler, Series B: Human Geography
AB  - This article extends Qviström's (2007; Geografiska Annaler: Series B, Human Geography 89 (3): 269-282) ideas concerning "landscapes out of order" within a re-discovering and re-imagining of spatial planning theory and practice. Taking the viewpoint that planners and decision-makers order and manage space in prescribed and constrained ways, the article argues that this can hinder innovative practices which have the potential to deliver significant societal and environmental benefits. Using case studies from permaculture and guerrilla gardening, we illustrate how planning practice can be rooted in confrontation and legal challenge rather than with more positive and inclusive approaches, as is envisaged within spatial planning theory. Clearly, the ways in which such initiatives intersect with the planning system raise important questions about joined-up policy across scales and sectors, and the ability of planning to be a proactive vehicle of environmental and social change. Our findings confirm that spatial planning theory is largely "disintegrated" (Scott et al. 2013; Progress in Planning 83: 1-52) from much contemporary planning and environmental practice and wider discourses of sustainability. This suggests an urgent re-examination of the spirit and purpose of planning to embrace and promote the new even where they challenge established orthodoxy and planning order. © 2013 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.

TI  - Tactical urbanism: The new vernacular of the creative city
AU  - Mould, O.
T2  - Geography Compass
AB  - The recent infatuation of urban governance with the ideologies of creativity has led to many cities over the world being branded as 'Creative Cities'. This policy drive has been problematised of late as a neoliberal agenda, which critics argue aids in the gentrification of cities. One reaction to this has been the proliferation of community-orientated initiatives on a smaller scale that are (sometimes) conducted outside the official capacity of the city. So-called Tactical Urbanism draws from such activity and therefore has become a popular movement for people who have a desire to change and reconfigure their city and do so without governmental involvement. Championed by the urbanist Mike Lydon, this paper charts how Tactical Urbanism has become a brand in itself, with the term being used by urban governments as a means of continuing neoliberal policies of urban development in a post-2008 recessionary era. This paper will show how Tactical Urbanism is defenestrating the former, in favour of the latter. In so doing, it is fast becoming the latest political vernacular of the Creative City. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Urban design principles of the original neighbourhood concepts
AU  - Patricios, N.N.
T2  - Urban Morphology
AB  - The neighbourhood concept is arguably one of the major planning landmarks that shaped the urban form of the twentieth-century city in many countries. Coincidently, both the neighbourhood idea of Clarence Stein and Henry Wright, exemplified in their plan for Radburn, and the neighbourhood unit idea of Clarence Perry were published in 1929. The urban design principles of Stein and Wright included the idea of a superblock of residential units grouped around a central green, the separation of vehicles and pedestrians, and a road hierarchy with culs-desac for local access roads. A cluster of superblocks was to form a self-contained neighbourhood. A group of neighbourhoods would then comprise the city. For Perry the physical arrangement of the elementary school, small parks and playgrounds, and local shops was the basis of his neighbourhood idea. Each neighbourhood was to be a 'unit' of the city. Briefly outlined are the deviations from the original ideas made subsequently by numerous architects, planners, developers, and bureaucrats. This article re-examines the intentions of Stein and Wright and Perry and the sources of their ideas to recover the principles of the original concepts that have become obscured over the decades.

TI  - Theaster gates's dorchester projects in Chicago
AU  - Reinhardt, K.
T2  - Journal of Urban History
AB  - In the projects of the artist Theaster Gates, social change and transformation is strongly tied to an actual rebuilding and reactivation of vacant architectures across the South Side of Chicago. Opposed to Richard Florida's analysis of the artist's role in the processes of gentrification, in Gates's model, the artist does not upvalue property in a decaying place only to then become victim to the outcome of this valorization, but the artist is a conscious and acting part in the very process himself with a designated long-term goal. Gates started acquiring abandoned houses at South Dorchester Avenue in Chicago's Grand Crossing area in 2006, and since then included them into an artist-activated ecology. He inserts architectural remainders into works of art that travel around the world, and when sold to collectors, he reinvests the profits into the reconstruction of the buildings and acquisition of further ones. Especially through an involvement and practical reworking and repurposing of architectural structures, Gates is performing a break from a passive emotional attachment to a nostalgic image of the spaces of non-lived memory that is a prevailing trend in photography at the moment as in the works of Yves Marchand and Romain Meffre for example. Gates's active placemaking includes the investment into the materiality and poetics of space, communal dinners, performances, film screenings and an artist residency program with a focus on sustainable site-specific projects. In Dorchester Projects, Gates's interests in a history of making, as well as the history of the city cumulate, but despite historical preferentiality, the places have a distinct atmosphere of nowness. He links his artistic practice and social agendas with architectural and aesthetic issues. Gates's recycling, or also upcycling, an "investment into the care of things" and the permanence of built places is testifying to his interest "to move back and forth between the real, the gestural, and the economic," all contributing to his "art of staying." © 2014 SAGE Publications.

TI  - Trends of forest dynamics in tiger landscapes across Asia
AU  - Mondal, P.
AU  - Nagendra, H.
T2  - Environmental Management
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are cornerstones of biodiversity conservation, but small parks alone cannot support wide-ranging species, such as the tiger. Hence, forest dynamics in the surrounding landscapes of PAs are also important to tiger conservation. Tiger landscapes often support considerable human population in proximity of the PA, sometimes within the core itself, and thus are subject to various land use activities (such as agricultural expansion and road development) driving habitat loss and fragmentation. We synthesize information from 27 journal articles in 24 tiger landscapes to assess forest-cover dynamics in tiger-range countries. Although 29% of the PAs considered in this study have negligible change in overall forest cover, approximately 71% are undergoing deforestation and fragmentation. Approximately 58% of the total case studies have human settlements within the core area. Most changes-including agricultural expansion, plantation, and farming (52%), fuelwood and fodder collection (43%), logging (38%), grazing (38%), and tourism and development (10%)-can be attributed to human impacts largely linked to the nature of the management regime. This study highlights the need for incorporating new perspectives, ideas, and lessons learned locally and across borders into management plans to ensure tiger conservation in landscapes dominated by human activities. Given the increasing isolation of most parks due to agricultural, infrastructural, and commercial developments at the periphery, it is imperative to conduct planning and evaluation at the landscape level, as well as incorporate multiple actors and institutions in planning, instead of focusing solely on conservation within the PAs as is currently the case in most tiger parks. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Green infrastructure grows up
AU  - Leonard, R.
T2  - Planning
AB  - Many states and local government have adopted green infrastructure policies such as green streets or rainwater harvesting codes. Adopting a variety of green infrastructure policies may be an effective approach in communities where there is political support and general acceptance of the benefits of green infrastructure. Tactical urbanism can be a game changing approach to green infrastructure. It provides support, resources and opportunities to help diverse communities reconnect places with their cultural and environmental contexts. Many communities have implemented prototypes so that they can prove the benefits of a particular green infrastructure method before allowing, requiring, or funding it throughout the community. Cities should closely examine their own policies to see what impending green infrastructure is. There needs to be an understanding of required maintenance of green infrastructure so that ongoing costs can be estimated accurately.

AB  - We examined the horizontal and vertical nocturnal cooling influence of a small park with irrigated lawn and xeric surfaces (~3 ha) within a university campus of a hot arid city. Temperature data from 0.01- to 3-m heights observed during a bicycle traverse of the campus were combined with modeled spatial temperature data simulated from a three-dimensional microclimate model (ENVI-met 3.1). A distinct park cool island, with mean observed magnitudes of 0.7-3.6°C, was documented for both traverse and model data with larger cooling intensities measured closer to surface level. Modeled results possessed varying but generally reasonable accuracy in simulating both spatial and temporal temperature data, although some systematic errors exist. A combination of several factors, such as variations in surface thermal properties, urban geometry, building orientation, and soil moisture, was likely responsible for influencing differential urban and non-urban near-surface temperatures. A strong inversion layer up to 1 m over non-urban surfaces was detected, contrasting with near-neutral lapse rates over urban surfaces. A key factor in the spatial expansion of the park cool island was the advection of cooler park air to adjacent urban surfaces, although this effect was mostly concentrated from 0- to 1-m heights over urban surfaces that were more exposed to the atmosphere. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Green space is an important component of the urban landscape, providing ecosystem services for city dwellers and supporting biodiversity. In many cities, green space is concentrated in large areas, while the rest is dispersed in small patches like pocket parks, gardens or street trees. Such small-scale green space is often the target of greening initiatives but little is known about their value for supporting and conserving biodiversity. To assess the value of such initiatives for biodiversity, we used birds as an indicator. We examined bird communities at small greening projects (n=12), nearby randomly chosen urban sites (n=12), and large parks (n=6) in Boston, MA, in relationship to underlying landscape patterns. Our results show that large parks harbor a distinct and rich bird community. The other sites, regardless of the presence of greening projects, were very similar to each other. However, most sites with greening projects had higher species richness than the random urban site in their vicinity. The main factor associated with this appears to be the patch size of green space and to a lesser extent, tree cavities. Even small increases of a few hundred square meters were associated with an increase in bird richness. Having more trees with cavities was also beneficial for species richness. Small greening projects appear to be most valuable for urban biodiversity if they target preserving, increasing and connecting existing green space. This may represent a tradeoff with environmental justice criteria for new green space. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Plant introduction and extirpation in a small island park: Natural and anthropogenic rates
AU  - Bourdages, M.
AU  - Lavoie, C.
T2  - Ecoscience
AB  - We conducted a historical (40 y) floristic assessment of a small (4 km 2) park in eastern Canada (Bonaventure Island National Park, Quebec) to evaluate whether small protected areas located in rural landscapes suffer declines in vascular plant populations. We hypothesized that the limited park access (an island accessible only by boat) has a greater influence than the size of the park per se on the preservation of the integrity of the flora. The island flora just before the creation of the protected area (1971) was compared to the flora surveyed during 2 consecutive summers (2007â€"2008) . Of the 358 taxa that were identified before 1971, only 21 (6% of the total) were not found in 2007â€"2008; of these 21, all but 1 were native taxa, and 17 are likely extirpated, which represents a "â€œnatural"â€ extirpation rate of about 1 taxon every 2 or 3 y. Twenty-four taxa found in 2007â€"2008 were apparently not present before 1971, 14 native taxa and 10 exotic taxa. This represents an introduction rate of 1 native and 1 exotic species every 2 or 3 y. The creation of the protected area did not totally prevent the extinction of native plants or the introduction of exotic species, but the island lost very few species during recent decades, at least compared to small urban parks where historical floristic assessments have been conducted. These urban parks were visited much more frequently than the island, which probably accounts for most of the differences. Strict regulations for visiting the island are apparently an excellent tool for preventing plant introduction (or extirpation), although they are by no means a barrier against the most invasive species.

AB  - OBJECTIVES. Physical activity may be constrained or facilitated by local environments. The availability of neighborhood facilities for physical activity may be particularly relevant for youth, who are unable to drive and whose activity is often limited to the immediate distance they are able to walk or bicycle. Several studies have shown that proximity to recreational facilities and parks is one of the most important predictors of physical activity. Because the United States already has an extensive infrastructure of parks, with 70% of adults indicating that they live within walking distance of a park or playground, parks may be a potential venue for increasing physical activity. This might be particularly important for adolescent girls, whose physical activity levels decline substantially as they go through puberty. The goal of this study was to examine the association between park proximity, park type, and park features and physical activity in adolescent girls. PATIENTS AND METHODS. This was a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls. It included 1556 grade 6 girls who were randomly selected from 6 middle schools in each of the following 6 field site areas: Washington, DC, and Baltimore, Maryland; Columbia, South Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New Orleans, Louisiana; Tucson, Arizona; and San Diego, California. Girls wore accelerometers for 6 days to measure metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, a measure accounting for the volume and intensity of activity. Metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was calculated for the hours outside of school time using 2 different cutpoints, activity levels ≥3.0 metabolic equivalents and ≥4.6 metabolic equivalents, the latter indicating activity at the intensity of a brisk walk or higher. We mapped all of the parks within 1 mile of each girl's home. Trained staff used a checklist to document the presence of facilities and amenities at each park, including passive amenities, such as drinking fountains, restrooms, and areas with shade, as well as active amenities like basketball courts, multipurpose fields, playgrounds, and tennis courts. RESULTS. Mean nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity, using the 4.6 metabolic equivalent cutoff, was 611.1 minutes (range: 49.7-4718.6 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days) and 1704.8 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days (range: 276.2-5792.6 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days) when using the 3.0 metabolic equivalent cutpoint. Many girls had multiple parks within a 1-mile radius of their homes: 57% had ≥1 type of park, the majority being neighborhood or community parks; 42% had between 1 and 3 parks, 37% had ≥4 parks, and 14% had ≥8 parks. The type, number, and specific parks features were associated with girls' nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity. At the 4.6 metabolic equivalent cutpoint, higher levels of nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity were associated with both neighborhood and community parks (22 metabolic equivalent minutes) and miniparks (40 metabolic equivalent minutes). Each park, regardless of type, in the half-mile around each girl's home was associated with an increase in nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity by 2.8% or 17.2 nonschool minutes of metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity per 6 days. Beyond a half-mile, each park increased nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity by 1.1% or 6.7 metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days. For the average girl with 3.5 parks within a 1-mile radius of home, the presence of parks accounted for 36.5 extra nonschool metabolic equivalent minutes per 6 days, ∼6% of total nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity. Using the 3.0 metabolic equivalent cutpoint, this sums to an additional 68 metabolic equivalent minutes of nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity over 6 days, or 4% of the total. The most common amenities in the parks were playgrounds, multipurpose fields, and picnic areas. Slightly more than one third of girls lived within a half-mile of a park with a basketball court, and >20% had access to walking paths and tennis courts in their local park. Higher levels of nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity per 6 days were associated with walking paths (13 metabolic equivalent minutes), running tracks (82 metabolic equivalent minutes), playgrounds (28 metabolic equivalent minutes), and basketball courts (30 metabolic equivalent minutes). Parks with streetlights and floodlights were also associated with an increase of 18 and 22 minutes of nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity, respectively. With the 3.0 metabolic equivalent cutoff for metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity, additional nonschool metabolic equivalent minutes more than doubled when girls had miniparks (92 metabolic equivalent minutes), natural resource areas (36 metabolic equivalent minutes), walking paths (59 metabolic equivalent minutes), and running tracks (208 metabolic equivalent minutes) within a half-mile of their homes. Skateboard areas and special-use parks were negatively associated with nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity in adolescent girls. CONCLUSIONS. Adolescent girls who live near more parks, particularly near those with amenities that are conducive to walking and with active features, engage in more nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity than those with fewer parks. Whether this is because of actual use of the parks or neighborhood choice could not be determined. Although the magnitude of the association between parks and additional minutes of metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity was small for an individual, amounting to an average of 4%-6% of a girl's total nonschool metabolic equivalent-weighted moderate/vigorous physical activity, it is likely to have a large population-level association. Because of the potential population level impact, the use of parks to promote physical activity should be further studied. Copyright © 2006 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

TI  - Rethinking urban transformation: Temporary uses for vacant land
AU  - Németh, J.
AU  - Langhorst, J.
T2  - Cities
AB  - As some cities grapple with economic decline and depopulating neighborhoods, a number of academics and professionals have focused their attention on the causes, conditions and patterns of the resultant vacant land, whereas others lay out broad programmatic, institutional, fiscal and design responses to address vacancy on site or citywide scales. We find that, regardless of condition and context, most responses advocate complex, officially sanctioned, formal programs and policies that call for or depend on implementation over several multi-year phases. While laudable in scope, we question whether "permanent" solutions are appropriate given the widely varying causes, durations, contexts and patterns of vacancy and the inability of similarly scoped government-led programs to thus far achieve intended goals or improve local quality of life. We present examples that make the case for temporary, incremental, flexible and experimental responses to urban vacant land, then conclude by outlining the potential benefits and drawbacks of this temporary use model. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - DIY urbanism: implications for cities
AU  - Finn, D.
T2  - Journal of Urbanism
AB  - A burgeoning do-it-yourself (DIY) urbanism movement is gaining notice in American and global cities as amateur designers create and implement small-scale interventions in urban public spaces. While tactics vary widely and may have some benefits for certain users, they nonetheless have the potential to complicate careful and considered long-term planning and urban design strategies. This article describes the historical and recent precedents upon which the current DIY urbanism movement is built and evaluates DIY interventions in light of their implications for cities, particularly how cities might engage with DIY projects in ways that maximize their potential for positive change while meeting objectives such as public safety, equity, and adherence to long-range visions. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Filling the gaps from the Christchurch earthquakes 2010-2013: Greening the rubble and the MT Pleasant Community Response Plan as two local initiatives
AU  - Montgomery, R.
T2  - Community, Environment and Disaster Risk Management
AB  - Between September 4, 2010 and mid-2013 a severe earthquake sequence struck Christchurch, the second largest city in New Zealand, causing multiple fatalities and the destruction of much of the central business district. Large areas of suburban residential housing were condemned with the prospect that entire neighbourhoods would be abandoned for several decades if not permanently. The recovery and rebuilding process was immediately placed high on central and local government agendas since Christchurch and the surrounding Canterbury region were and continue to be seen as crucial to the security and stability of the national economy. Programmes for recovery developed initially relied principally on one-off funding packages and strategies from central government, local government recovery plans and the settlement of commercial insurance claims. There remains, however, the spectre of Christchurch as a city of demolition sites and vacant lots for the best part of a decade if not longer. Furthermore, although local and national Civil Defence and Emergency Management systems were activated during the most severe seismic events the response operations did not always reach those in need as promptly as was expected. Residents in a number of communities and neighbourhoods are now conscious that when disaster strikes they are still likely to have to fend for themselves. This chapter documents and evaluates two specific "gap-filling" responses to the Christchurch earthquakes over a three-year period. The first response considered is a community-based project called "Greening the Rubble" which took root in October 2010 as the prospect of a central city of vacant lots and car parks worried a number of volunteers into action to temporarily cheer up empty public and private sites with pocket parks, native plant displays and cultural interventions. The second initiative scrutinised, the "Mt Pleasant Community Response Plan 2012-2013," is one of the first community-based emergency response plans to emerge that has sought to complement official civil defence planning arrangements. Both responses are discussed in detail in the context of constantly changing and evolving hazardscapes and socio-economic and political conditions. © Smithers Rapra Technology, 2014.

T2  - Journal of Urbanism
AB  - This article examines forms of do-it-yourself (DIY) urbanism practised by two Roma communities in Rome. The groups live in self-made camps that exist in a legal limbo determined by municipal policies that fluctuate between ‘tolerating’ and threatening to demolish them. We argue that it is the simultaneous solidity and temporaneity of residents’ DIY interventions that have delayed their eviction. We analyse how residents have sought to create dignified conditions through the informal architecture of their homes, to access water and electricity, and to create areas of beauty and safety around themselves. In doing so, they practice a form of tactical urbanism, generating environments for sociality and forging public spaces in apparent ‘non-places’: on a highway exchange and in a parking lot. Their DIY is accepted by the authorities as long as it is ‘light’, does not engage urban infrastructure and remains within abject locations. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In this paper, we examine do-it-yourself (DIY) urbanism through place-based and technology initiatives that support collective networked action to foster civic engagement in neighborhood contexts. The goal is to engage informal and ad-hoc networks of individual and collective actors in productively addressing critical conditions within their urban localities. Based on participatory research and co-design with residents and urban activist groups, Delai Sam and Partizaning, in districts of Moscow, Russia, we devised a series of interventions using a network of mailboxes, prototype online collaboration platforms (SynchroniCITY and MicroAct) and community-based workshops to engage participants in revealing issues, designing solutions and coordinating urban actions. Through these experiences, we consider the challenges of DIY urbanism as an inclusive, sustained and meaningful form of cooperative engagement and urban activism. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Urban forest fragments, such as parks and squares provide food resources, shelter, and favorable conditions for the maintenance of butterflies. This study provides an inventory of butterflies and observations of plants visited by adults in a small urban park, the Américo Renê Giannetti Municipal city park, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State. We sampled an area of 18.2 ha from December 2006 to December 2007 with entomological net and traps baited with fermented fruits. We recorded 165 individuals belonging to 78 species, as follows: 46 spp. of Nymphalidae; 10 spp. of Hesperiidae, seven spp. of Lycaenidae, seven spp. of Pieridae, five spp. of Riodinidae; and three species of Papilionidae. Between the plants visited the more attractive was Lantana camara (Verbenaceae), a shrub with flowers of vibrant colors and common source of nectar and pollen. The butterflies recorded show the importance of maintenance of urban green areas, providing favorable conditions for the permanence of butterflies, even in anthropic environments.

T2  - African Journal of Wildlife Research
AB  - Bontebok National Park was established to protect the bontebok from extinction and more recently a small herd of Cape mountain zebra was also introduced into the park. Although the latter were introduced into the park to facilitate the grazing of bontebok and thereby reduce the use of fire by park management, recent work suggests that these ungulates compete for recently burnt veld. This work, however, was done at a relatively broad scale, while we used counts of bontebok and mountain zebra dung groups to assess the habitat use of these ungulates at a finer scale. In our analysis we stratified the study area according to vegetation type, veld age and fire history. Our results suggest that bontebok are more closely associated with burnt veld than mountain zebra and that both favour the Drainage Line and Kraal Lawn vegetation types over the other vegetation types in the park. The importance of these vegetation types has previously been overlooked and should be included in future monitoring of herbivore habitat use.

TI  - The bystander effect and social control behavior: The effect of the presence of others on people's reactions to norm violations
AU  - Chekroun, P.
AU  - Brauer, M.
T2  - European Journal of Social Psychology
AB  - Observers of deviant social behavior sometimes communicate disapproval directly or indirectly to the perpetrator of a deviant act. This reaction has been termed 'social control'. Three field studies were conducted to explore the influence of the number of bystander-observers on the likelihood of social control. We predicted that the presence of others would inhibit people's tendency to communicate their disapproval to the deviant but only if personal implication was low. In the first study, we measured participants' perceptions of two fictive situations, one in which a deviant draws graffiti in an elevator of a shopping center and one in which a deviant litters in a small neighborhood park by throwing a plastic bottle in the bushes. As expected, participants considered both behaviors to be equally counternormative but felt personally more implicated by the littering behavior in the park. In Studies 2 and 3, the two situations were enacted with confederates of the experimenter. Naïve bystanders served as participants, and social control was the primary dependent variable. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found evidence for a bystander effect in the low personal implication situation ('graffiti in the elevator') but not in the high personal implication situation ('littering in park'). These results make clear that perceived personal implication moderates the extent to which people are inhibited by the presence of others when they decide whether they should exert social control or not.

AU  - Adams, D.

T2  - Urban Studies
AB  - Despite an emerging literature on guerrilla gardening as a political practice in public spaces, with few exceptions, these accounts theorise it as working against many corporate and bureaucratic forms of power. Using the example of 'F Troop'-a group of gardeners operating on a site in an English midland city-this paper focuses on the practices of urban guerrilla gardening in order to illustrate that these are perhaps not as 'resistant' or 'celebratory' as previous accounts have suggested. Rather, this paper draws on ethnographic data to focus attention on the micro politics of garden activism, arguing that the social backgrounds and motivations of those involved in guerrilla gardening and their relationship with other users of the space surrounding the dig site are also important-but largely underacknowledged-aspects of guerrilla gardening. © 2013 Urban Studies Journal Limited.

T2  - New Armenian Medical Journal
AB  - The problem of hygienic regulation of microclimate in southern cities is of great scientific interest related to the unfavorable influence of the excess heat on the human organism. The hot and dry climate causes overheating of the human organism and brings to a significant tension in functions of the thermoregulating apparatus. One of the most important sanitary-hygienic problems is to provide environmental conditions comfortable for the human health. Creation of the artificial microclimate in southern cities and towns by means of rational greenery planting is of utmost importance. As an integral element of complex organization of public services and amenities and landscape organization of territories, greenery planting provides formation of the favorable environment with the active use of vegetative components. From 2007 to 2010, large-scale reorganization of greenery planting was conducted in the clinics of Yerevan State Medical University (YSMU). As a result of complex evaluation of the physical, chemical, sociohygienic factors and elements of architectural planning in the clinics conditions, we worked out and implemented principles of greenery planting directed at restoration of hospital environment and making it esthetic. The aim of the present work is to evaluate measures on rearrangement of greenery planting according to the microclimatic indices and the acoustic level at the territory of "Heratsi" hospital area and the zone attached to it. Data obtained as a result of the investigation demonstrated that even small green space has impact on the microclimate decreasing the temperature and increasing relative humidity of the air and allows to testify that the rational planting at the medical preventive institution is able to reduce the noise level and provide a proper treating-preventive regimen in the hospital.

AU  - Randall, T.A.

AU  - Baetz, B.W.
T2  - Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design
AB  - A prototype decision support tool is described which provides options for the management of existing green spaces and for the establishment of new green space in suburban neighbourhoods. Suggested neighbourhood greening techniques include the naturalization of existing parks and increased foliage along streets and rights of way. The naturalization approach involves less frequent cutting in grassy fields, the introduction of native species, and the cessation of pesticide and herbicide applications. Increased plantings along streets and boulevards would improve the aesthetics of neighbourhoods, and may provide some relief from climatic extremes and urban heat island effects. The creation of new green space in already-built suburban neighbourhoods provides a longer term challenge to neighbourhood planners. Potential strategies include the introduction of small pocket parks and community gardens in vacant lots and school yards. Modelled outcomes from such neighbourhood greening strategies could be used in public meetings both to incorporate attitudes of the impacted community and to demonstrate benefits to a wider community. In particular, strategies should take into account issues of safety and perceived safety that commonly arise with the greater use of naturalization in green space management. The developed prototype decision support tool has been coded as an ArcView GIS extension and provides the opportunity to model and evaluate future scenarios better aligned to principles of sustainable community development. Three applications of this tool are discussed to illustrate some of the benefits of undertaking a range of neighbourhood greening strategies.

TI  - Do-it-yourself urbanism: A history
AU  - Talen, E.
T2  - Journal of Planning History
AB  - In the last several years, interest has surged in the idea of small-scale, incremental, ‘‘do-it-yourself’’ (DIY) urban improvement. Also known as ‘‘tactical,’’ ‘‘pop-up,’’ or ‘‘guerilla’’ urbanism, this brand of urban intervention is resident-generated, low budget, and often designed to be temporary. The approach is distinguished by being in direct opposition to top-down, capital-intensive, and bureau-cratically sanctioned urban change of the kind most often associated with urban planning. The purpose of this article is to review the broader, historical rootedness of these efforts. DIY urbanism has been energized by a recession and a ‘‘right to the city’’ spirit of guerrilla tactics, but it is actually rooted in a deeper tradition of nineteenth-century civic engagement. Focusing on the American experience, I show that the idea of bottom-up, tactical, DIY urbanism forms an essential tradition in American urbanism, an impulse that runs counter to the narrative of urban abandonment, and as such forms an essential platform upon which notions of any ‘‘back to the city’’ movement draw support. © 2014 The Author(s).

AB  - In densifying cities, small green spaces such as pocket parks are likely to become more important as settings for restoration. Well-designed small parks may serve restoration well, but earlier research on restorative environments does not provide detailed information about the specific components of the physical environment that support restoration. In this study we assessed the extent to which hardscape, grass, lower ground vegetation, flowering plants, bushes, trees, water, and size predicted the judged possibility for restoration in small urban green spaces. We took individual parks as the units of analysis. The parks were sampled from Scandinavian cities, and each park was represented by a single photo. Each photo was quantified in terms of the different objective park components and also rated on psychological variables related to restoration. The ratings on the psychological variables being away, fascination, likelihood of restoration, and preference were provided by groups of people familiar with such parks. The variables most predictive of the likelihood of restoration were the percentage of ground surface covered by grass, the amount of trees and bushes visible from the given viewing point, and apparent park size. Formal mediation analyses indicated distinctive patterns of full and partial mediation of the relations between environmental components and restoration likelihood by being away and fascination. Our results provide guidance for the design of small yet restorative urban parks. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of our paper is to provide an in-depth look at guerrilla gardening as an example of sustainability in action. Through participatory action research methods that triangulate content analysis, 16 semi-structured interviews and researcher logs, two case studies were developed. The first was of Dig Kingston, a guerrilla gardening project and the second of the Oak Street Community Garden, both located in Kingston Ontario. The focus of the research was on guerrilla gardening, while the community gardening case was used for contrast and to deepen our analysis. Key themes that emerged from our case research included expression, intervention and spatial manipulation. Our main findings present a deeper understanding of guerrilla gardening as well as an analysis on the relationship between space and sustainability. In particular our paper lays the groundwork for how interventions, like guerrilla gardening, open up unexpected and non-normative possibilities for conceptualising sustainability. These themes contribute to current understandings of sustainability by illustrating how a localised action that operates outside of spatial expectations, in this case guerrilla gardening, is a powerful pathway towards producing engaging and sustainable communities. Thus, our paper contributes to the growing body of literature on open, reflexive and critical models of sustainability. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - The cooling effect of green spaces as a contribution to the mitigation of urban heat: A case study in Lisbon
AU  - Oliveira, S.

T2  - Building and Environment
AB  - Green areas in the urban environment can contribute to the mitigation of the Urban Heat Island. In a context of climate change, with the expected increase in temperature, dryness and intensity of heat waves, green areas assume even higher importance as they can create a cooling effect that extends to the surrounding areas. This study analyses the thermal performance of a small green space (0.24 ha) and its influence in the surrounding atmospheric environment of a densely urbanised area in Lisbon. Measurements of weather parameters (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar and infrared radiation) were carried out along a selected path, starting from inside the green area to surrounding streets with different orientations and solar exposure. It was found that the garden was cooler than the surrounding areas, either in the sun or in the shade. These differences were higher in hotter days and particularly related to the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt). The highest difference found was of 6.9 °C in relation to air temperature and 39.2 °C in relation to Tmrt; in both cases this difference occurred between the shaded site inside the garden and the sunny site in an E-W oriented street in the southern part of the studied area. Besides the local weather conditions, particularly the low wind speed, the sun exposure and the urban geometry are the potential factors that explain these differences. The cooling effect of green areas on the surrounding environment can be enhanced by additional measures related to the urban features of each city. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Effects of urban configuration on human thermal conditions in a typical tropical African coastal city
AU  - Ndetto, E.L.

T2  - Advances in Meteorology
AB  - A long-term simulation of urban climate was done using the easily available long-term meteorological data from a nearby synoptic station in a tropical coastal city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The study aimed at determining the effects of buildings' height and street orientations on human thermal conditions at pedestrian level. The urban configuration was represented by a typical urban street and a small urban park near the seaside. The simulations were conducted in the microscale applied climate model of RayMan, and results were interpreted in terms of the thermal comfort parameters of mean radiant (T mrt) and physiologically equivalent (PET) temperatures. PET values, high as 34°C, are observed to prevail during the afternoons especially in the east-west oriented streets, and buildings' height of 5 m has less effect on the thermal comfort. The optimal reduction of T mrt and PET values for pedestrians was observed on the nearly north-south reoriented streets and with increased buildings' height especially close to 100 m. Likewise, buildings close to the park enhance comfort conditions in the park through additional shadow. The study provides design implications and management of open spaces like urban parks in cities for the sake of improving thermal comfort conditions for pedestrians. © 2013 Emmanuel Lubango Ndetto and Andreas Matzarakis.

AB  - Purpose. To determine whether body mass index (BMI) is associated with proximity to neighborhood parks, the size of the parks, their cleanliness, and the availability of recreational facilities in the parks. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. New York City. Subjects. Adults (13,102) were recruited from 2000 to 2002 (median age 45 years, 36% male). Measures. Anthropometric and sociodemographic data from study subjects were linked to Department of Parks & Recreation data on park space, cleanliness, and facilities. Neighborhood-level sociodemographic and park proximity metrics were created for half-mile-radius circular buffers around each subject's residence. Proximity to park space was measured as the proportion of the subject's neighborhood buffer area that was total park space, large park space (a park ≤6 acres) and small park space (a park >6 acres). Analysis. Hierarchical linear models were used to determine whether neighborhood park metrics were associated with BMI. Results. Higher proximity to large park space was significantly associated with lower BMI (beta = -1.69, 95% confidence interval = -2.76, -.63). Across the population distribution of proximity to large park space, compared to subjects living in neighborhoods at the 10th percentile of the distribution, the covariate-adjusted average BMI was estimated to be .35 kg/m2 lower for those living in neighborhoods at the 90th percentile. The proportion of neighborhood area that was small park space was not associated with BMI, nor was park cleanliness or the availability of recreational facilities. Conclusion. Neighborhood proximity to large park spaces is modestly associated with lower BMI in a diverse urban population. Copyright © 2013 by American Journal of Health Promotion, Inc.

TI  - Can small wildlife conservancies maintain genetically stable populations of large mammals? Evidence for increased genetic drift in geographically restricted populations of Cape buffalo in East Africa

AB  - The Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) is one of the dominant and most widespread herbivores in sub-Saharan Africa. High levels of genetic diversity and exceptionally low levels of population differentiation have been found in the Cape buffalo compared to other African savannah ungulates. Patterns of genetic variation reveal large effective population sizes and indicate that Cape buffalos have historically been interbreeding across considerable distances. Throughout much of its range, the Cape buffalo is now largely confined to protected areas due to habitat fragmentation and increasing human population densities, possibly resulting in genetic erosion. Ten buffalo populations in Kenya and Uganda were examined using seventeen microsatellite markers to assess the regional genetic structure and the effect of protected area size on measures of genetic diversity. Two nested levels of genetic structure were identified: a higher level partitioning populations into two clusters separated by the Victoria Nile and a lower level distinguishing seven genetic clusters, each defined by one or two study populations. Although relatively small geographic distances separate most of the study populations, the level of genetic differentiation found here is comparable to that among pan-African populations. Overall, correlations between conservancy area and indices of genetic diversity suggest buffalo populations inhabiting small parks are showing signs of genetic erosion, stressing the need for more active management of such populations. Our findings raise concerns about the future of other African savannah ungulates with lower population sizes and inferior dispersal capabilities compared with the buffalo. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This article reports the results of an empirical study on summertime environmental performances of a pocket park in Hong Kong. The results suggest that (i) wind condition has a critical impact on outdoor air temperature (Ta), especially in a tropical area like Hong Kong and (ii) building geometry is significantly related to outdoor Ta in Hong Kong. The shading effect from buildings may be more important than shading and evapotranspiration effect of greenery in the unique urban context of Hong Kong. © The Author 2012.

T2  - Journal of Urban Planning and Development
AB  - Small urban greenspaces, such as neighborhood parks and private gardens, have often been overlooked or considered unlikely habitat sources owing to their small size, even though they may still provide important nesting and food resources for common songbirds. The objective of this study was to determine the role of small greenspaces, comprising a variety of land-use types, by assessing the distribution and abundance of four common songbird species. Point count data collected by the Baltimore Ecosystem Study were analyzed for four common urban songbirds: American robin (Turdus migratorius), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). Vacant land, small parks, and residential land cover within a 200 m radius for each point count location were calculated as a proxy for private lawns and gardens,. Abundance modeling was conducted to determine which land-cover types best predicted the abundance values of each species and the distribution of each species across the city was mapped. American robin abundance was positively associated with small parks and negatively associated with vacant land, indicating that some form of greenspace management might be necessary for American robin use, specifically for foraging in short grass or nesting in younger trees. European starlings were negatively associated with small parks and had the greatest occurrence probability within the densely developed areas of downtown Baltimore. Results from this study can inform landscape planners of the benefits of certain spatial configurations and land uses that could increase urban biodiversity and sustainability. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The desire to improve urban sustainability is motivating many city planners to adopt growth strategies that increase residential density, leading to substantial changes to urban landscapes. What effect this change will have on biodiversity remains unclear, but it is expected that the role of public greenspace in providing wildlife habitat will become critical. We explored the role of urban "pocket parks" as habitat for birds, and how this role changed with increasing residential density in the surrounding neighbourhood. We found that parks in neighbourhoods with high levels of public greenspace (corresponding to less residential land) supported more bird species and individuals overall, and more woodland-dependent species, insectivores and hollow-nesters. Total greenspace area was more important (included in the best ranked models for all bird responses) than the configuration (number, average size and connectivity) of greenspace patches. The majority of species were common suburban birds, indicating that species we assume are tolerant to urban areas will be negatively affected by increasing residential density. Parks form part of an interconnected network of urban open space. For parks to continue to support a diverse native bird community, the network must be viewed, managed, and maintained in its entirety. We suggest three key management actions to improve the bird diversity values of urban greenspaces in compact cities: (1) Increase urban greenspace cover in residential neighbourhoods. (2) Increase vegetation structure in greenspace. (3) Encourage homeowners to plant trees and shrubs. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The Ol' Man River's banks have become the target of restoration across the country. For instance, a recent project for MACTEC Engineering and Consulting Inc. involved a 600ft stretch of riverbank along Androscoggin River. It includes stabilization of a 2.5 acres of steep riverbank to remove surficial fill and debris intermixed with soil, and to mitigate erosion of any remaining manufactured gas plant (MGP) residuals from the previous manufacturing operation. The project also called for restoring upland areas at the top of the bank as a recreational park with walking trails and a scenic overlook. Other projects include rebuilding the slopes of the Maurice River, by constructing a public boat dock, and create a small park across the street from the City Hall; a stabilization project of the C-51 Canal at West Palm Beach involving repair of shoreline; widening Forester creek, revegetation of the banks, construction of a new bridge, and lengthening of an existing bridge; and introduction of freshwater into a marsh, addressing saltwater intrusion and lack of freshwater and sediment input in the Chenier sub-basin.

AB  - Planners and policy makers are able to use information and data from tactical urbanism projects to shape investments in more permanent change. The PAS Memo will focus on three major ways to apply tactical urbanism to the planning profession, such as visioning, testing, and implementation. There are many examples of tactical urbanism's integration into the work of professional planners in the United States and Canada. The tactics of the movement range from the sanctioned to the unsanctioned. Interventions start from individuals and grassroots organizations, reacting to a deficiency in their built environments.

TI  - Trapping Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae) with pheromone baited multiple-funnel traps does not reduce Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) mortality

AB  - Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins) (DFB) causes considerable mortality to Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in western North American forests. We evaluated the use of semiochemical-baited multiple-funnel traps for the protection of small, high-value stands of trees, such as those occurring in campgrounds, rest areas, and small parks when Douglas-fir mortality caused by populations of DFB were at levels of concern to land managers. At two sites in western Montana in 2004, three treated plots were surrounded by three trapping stations arranged in an equilateral triangle (200 m per triangle side). Similar, untreated plots were used for comparison. More than 2 million DFB were trapped and removed from treated plots during 2004, but this trapping did not protect Douglas-fir at either site. Conversely, the ratio of infested to living trees increased substantially due to trapping at one of the sites. Placing semiochemical lures adjacent to stands of susceptible trees may have concentrated beetles from the surrounding area. Though many beetles were trapped, large numbers of beetles did not enter the traps and consequently attacked trees in our plots. Positioning pheromone traps immediately adjacent to high-value Douglas-fir stands when beetle population densities are high, does not appear to reduce overall tree mortality in target stands and sometimes increases it. However, trapping combined with sanitation and/or and antiaggregant may be a viable treatment. © Pacific Coast Entomological Society.

T2  - Tourism Analysis
AB  - This study evaluates forecasting accuracy among several competing methodologies, including time series and econometric methods, on visitation to 255 US National Park Service (NPS) sites. The performance of these models is contrasted with the model currently in use by the NPS. One-yearahead, 2-year-ahead, and combined (1- and 2-year-ahead) forecasting performance at the individual park level is examined utilizing several measures of forecasting accuracy, including root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Results indicate incorporating economic variables can significantly improve forecasts, particularly for large and small parks. For medium size parks the naive forecast errors were typically lowest. Furthermore, the naive model performed well, often producing the best forecast, followed by the econometric model. Regionally, the naive and econometric models preform best, with the Pacificwest region being the exception. Utilizing the most accurate model for each park leads to a 24% improvement over current forecasts (1-year horizon) and suggests that a mixed model approach is optimal. © 2014 Cognizant Comm. Corp.

TI  - Distribution of Wild Mammal Assemblages along an Urban-Rural-Forest Landscape Gradient in Warm-Temperate East Asia
AU  - Saito, M.
AU  - Koike, F.
T2  - PLoS ONE
AB  - Urbanization may alter mammal assemblages via habitat loss, food subsidies, and other factors related to human activities. The general distribution patterns of wild mammal assemblages along urban-rural-forest landscape gradients have not been studied, although many studies have focused on a single species or taxon, such as rodents. We quantitatively evaluated the effects of the urban-rural-forest gradient and spatial scale on the distributions of large and mid-sized mammals in the world's largest metropolitan area in warm-temperate Asia using nonspecific camera-trapping along two linear transects spanning from the urban zone in the Tokyo metropolitan area to surrounding rural and forest landscapes. Many large and mid-sized species generally decreased from forest landscapes to urban cores, although some species preferred anthropogenic landscapes. Sika deer (Cervus nippon), Reeves' muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), Japanese squirrel (Sciurus lis), Japanese marten (Martes melampus), Japanese badger (Meles anakuma), and wild boar (Sus scrofa) generally dominated the mammal assemblage of the forest landscape. Raccoon (Procyon lotor), raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), and Japanese hare (Lepus brachyurus) dominated the mammal assemblage in the intermediate zone (i.e., rural and suburban landscape). Cats (feral and free-roaming housecats; Felis catus) were common in the urban assemblage. The key spatial scales for forest species were more than 4000-m radius, indicating that conservation and management plans for these mammal assemblages should be considered on large spatial scales. However, small green spaces will also be important for mammal conservation in the urban landscape, because an indigenous omnivore (raccoon dog) had a smaller key spatial scale (500-m radius) than those of forest mammals. Urbanization was generally the most important factor in the distributions of mammals, and it is necessary to consider the spatial scale of management according to the degree of urbanization. © 2013 Saito, Koike.

T2  - Natural Areas Journal
AB  - Using a scorecard approach, we assessed the condition of natural resources within the major habitats in Mount Rushmore National Memorial (MORU), South Dakota, and Niobrara National Scenic River (NIOB), Nebraska, as part of a "pilot" effort to determine a National Park Service (NPS) system-wide approach to Natural Resource Condition Assessments (NRCA). Both parks are considered small - MORU because of size (517 ha) and NIOB because the NPS does not own land within the boundary of the park. Small parks often contain resources that are not well-known because they lack research, monitoring, and staff expertise. However, we found adequate information to assess the condition, and sometimes trend, of 12 of 15 biodiversity and process indicators at MORU and 17 of 22 at NIOB, although most of the data we used to establish reference conditions came from sources outside of the parks. We believe forested habitats at MORU and NIOB are in poor condition and deteriorating primarily due to the suppression of fire for over 100 years. This is in contrast to the rivers, streams, and wetland habitats at both parks that are in good condition but threatened by an exotic fish (MORU) and reductions in streamflow and exotic plants (NIOB). For two habitats - stream and wetland (MORU) and Niobrara River and tributaries (NIOB) - we suggest several indicators of current condition be added as Vital Signs for long-term monitoring. The score-card approach is limited to those small parks with data to establish reference conditions for indicators.

AB  - The relationships Walk Your City are building with cities are allowing for deployments of physical infrastructure in a matter of weeks, not years, and for thousands of dollars, not millions. The tool integrates with Google maps, provides campaign profiles with maps, and allows for keyhole markup language data download of a campaign for integration with existing GIS databases. Walk Your City is an exciting venture that provides real change in the built environment in a short amount of time. As opposed to traditional traffic engineering installations that can be heavy, expensive, and time-consuming, these wayfinding campaigns are a form of tactical urbanism, catching the attention of transportation professionals, policymakers, and citizens alike for their ability to bring about a more walkable environment.

AB  - Urban green spaces provide ecosystem services to city residents, but their management is hindered by a poor understanding of their ecology. We examined a novel ecosystem service relevant to urban public health and esthetics: the consumption of littered food waste by arthropods. Theory and data from natural systems suggest that the magnitude and resilience of this service should increase with biological diversity. We measured food removal by presenting known quantities of cookies, potato chips, and hot dogs in street medians (24 sites) and parks (21 sites) in New York City, USA. At the same sites, we assessed ground-arthropod diversity and abiotic conditions, including history of flooding during Hurricane Sandy 7 months prior to the study. Arthropod diversity was greater in parks (on average 11 hexapod families and 4.7 ant species per site), than in medians (nine hexapod families and 2.7 ant species per site). However, counter to our diversity-based prediction, arthropods in medians removed 2-3 times more food per day than did those in parks. We detected no effect of flooding (at 19 sites) on this service. Instead, greater food removal was associated with the presence of the introduced pavement ant (Tetramorium sp. E) and with hotter, drier conditions that may have increased arthropod metabolism. When vertebrates also had access to food, more was removed, indicating that arthropods and vertebrates compete for littered food. We estimate that arthropods alone could remove 4-6.5 kg of food per year in a single street median, reducing its availability to less desirable fauna such as rats. Our results suggest that species identity and habitat may be more relevant than diversity for predicting urban ecosystem services. Even small green spaces such as street medians provide ecosystem services that may complement those of larger habitat patches across the urban landscape. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Iconic eyesores: exploring do-it-yourself preservation and civic improvement at abandoned train stations in Buffalo and Detroit
AU  - Campo, D.
T2  - Journal of Urbanism
AB  - This inquiry documents two citizen-driven campaigns to reclaim iconic train stations and their adjacent landscapes, assessing their effectiveness as agents of preservation and civic improvement, and potential as catalysts for local development. Examining grassroots efforts to conserve and reuse Buffalo’s Central Terminal and Detroit’s Michigan Central Station and the adjacent Roosevelt Park, it considers a unique form of preservation practice – one devoid of significant public sector funding and the conventional market-based adaptive reuse strategies that are ineffective in declining settings. Driven by idiosyncratic collectives of residents, business owners, cultural entrepreneurs, artists, designers, and planners, these groups coalesce around a shared desire to conserve local landmarks and play an active role in the physical rebuilding of their cities. Their incremental and incomplete transformations are driven by an ethic that transcends both typical market-oriented targets (private sector profits or “pays-for-itself”) and the “fully restored” end states that are the goals of conventional projects. While these acts of reclamation are far from complete, they have the potential to inform similar locally driven efforts in settings of decline. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Eye tracking was used to investigate the task of assessing how likely it is that one would be able to rest and recover in small urban spaces and how it affects the view pattern. We assess which environmental components, for example, flowers and trees, participants look at when evaluating restoration likelihood. Further, we compare number of fixations in restorative and non-restorative park photos. Photos were selected based on ratings of low and high likelihood of restoration. Participants were asked to imagine themselves in need of restoration. Photos were presented for 10 seconds each. In contrast to studies adapting a free viewing approach, the present study shows that image properties such as contrast and colour did not attract attention; instead participants looked at components that were of importance for assessing restoration likelihood. The components participants looked at the most were trees, followed by benches and bushes. This presents new information on people's view patterns in relation to the task of rating restoration likelihood. In addition, relations between the park components at which participants looked the most and the ratings on restoration likelihood were explored. As expected, we found a positive correlation between grass and restoration likelihood. The relations were negative for all other variables, although not significant. The negative relations were rather unexpected, and possible explanations for them are discussed. Finally, we analysed the association between number of fixations and restoration likelihood ratings, and no correlation was found. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The use of urban green environments has repeatedly been associated with improved health and well-being for people living in cities. This study focuses on the health promoting potential of pocket parks in the dense city area of Copenhagen. A natural experiment was conducted, which evaluated one pocket park, Dantes Plads, before and after a redesign. Six people were interviewed about their perception of the change. First of all, the results show that Dantes Plads is primarily used for 'rest and restitution'. Furthermore, the interviewees prefer to have the presence of sun, shade and planting in relation to rest and restitution, while varied 'terrain' may create fascination thereby providing the opportunity for restoration. 'Noise level' is perceived differently from subject to subject, while 'benches' as well as 'visual angels' should not be oriented directly towards disturbing surroundings. The findings add to existing knowledge on the design of health promoting pocket parks for 'rest and restitution' in dense city areas. © 2014 Archnet-IJAR.

TI  - Why small parks matter
AU  - Forsyth, A.
AU  - Musacchio, L.
T2  - Planning
AB  - We've all seen them: public parks and other publicly accessible green spaces measuring less than five to six acres - or one city block - in size. Many are equipped with a standard array of play structures, lawn, trees, and benches. Others line trails and waterways. Some are the signature elements in new subdivisions, and still others take the form of leftover spaces, remnant ecosystems, and undevelopable land. However, with the exceptions of downtown parks such as San Francisco's Grant Park and Manhattan's Bryant Park, small parks are typically known only to nearby residents. They are part of the daily pattern of life, not major icons. Whatever form they take, small parks are common in small towns and large metropolitan areas alike, providing recreational and open space for millions of people nationwide. From improving water and air quality to providing activities for immigrant seniors and low-income youth, small parks are a community asset. They help the ecology, and they help people. However, their very size puts them at a disadvantage. Small parks rarely attract major investment, particularly when they are being redesigned. Faced with the choice of lavishing planning and design funds on a regional park or a series of small neighborhood parks, most agencies spend their money on the showcases - the large parks with hundreds of acres. That is something we would like to change.

AB  - The American Planning Association's (APA) Great Places in America program has designated 10 great neighborhoods, 10 great streets, and 10 great public places that people will remember for generations. The places chosen show a balance between preserving valuable historic resources and encouraging the kind of new development that supports healthy communities. Duke of Gloucester Street Williamsburg, Virginia, has been authentically and successfully recreated. The houses along East Newberry Boulevard, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, showcase the styles popular among Milwaukee's middle and upper classes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Front Street, Traverse City, Michigan, offers scenic views of the Boardman River, the Jay Smith Walkway pocket park, bountiful sidewalks with benches and shade trees. Main Street, Greenville, South Carolina, is the place where a variety of building styles such as Victorian, neoclassical, Beaux-Arts, Romanesque revival, and early 20th century skyscrapers, originated.

AB  - Informal or incidental learning in recreational parks has been rarely assessed, although most city-dwellers enjoy and appreciate wildlife in their day-to-day lives. Incidental or informal learning is non-intentional and grows out of spontaneous situations and is mostly self-directed, Here, we focus on the informal setting of a small urban park in Ludwigsburg (Germany) as a source of incidental learning. Two hundred and forty-eight visitors were interviewed at the park using a questionnaire, and 102 other people (non-visitors) acted as a control group. Park visitors scored significantly better in their knowledge of animal species compared with our control group. Species knowledge increased with age, with number of park visits, and with educational level. Using the number of species visitors had previously seen at the park, we found a significant influence of educational level, park visiting frequency, and of park use. Ninety-seven percent of participants responded with positive attitudes towards animals, and most animals were detected by their movement, rather than by their sound or coloration. © ISAZ 2007.

T2  - Journal of Urban Technology
AB  - A delicate touch is required to empower neighborhoods using civic media. Funding is persistently scarce. Especially in marginalized neighborhoods, blunt designs can be counterproductive and even entrench complex problems. New metaphors may be needed to guide design and empower local neighborhoods. Urban acupuncture is used as the basis for this study, emphasizing a light-touch strategy that has shown success in Brazil with urban transit, and more recently in Europe with urban design. We specifically propose “neighborhood acupuncture” to address the local level, tapping the sociology of place-based communication. To investigate the implications for systematic design, a case study is probed in South Los Angeles using mobile media for community mapping. Using qualitative methods, three tactics were investigated for the potential to “poke” the network into action, including one to bridge diverse storytelling networks. Each tactic ultimately seeks to build the capacity for collective action around neighborhood issues. Acupuncture is broadly argued to sustain two design shifts: first to help approach neighborhoods as ecosystems, and second, to design for circulation rather than any single technology platform. © 2015 The Society of Urban Technology.

AB  - The goal of the present study was to assess which variables influence the distribution of birds in urban parks. Twenty parks were studied in a city on the Spanish high plateau during the breeding season, and relationships among park characteristics, bird richness, and individual bird presences were established. The park area and tree cover accounted for 73.1% of the variation in bird richness. Although area size was the best predictor of species richness (65% of the variation), some species did not seem to be related to this variable but rather to others, such as vegetation and the degree of park isolation with respect to other areas. Contrary to what is normally expected, the distance from our parks to the river did not influence their bird species richness. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - In the year of its 175th anniversary, the Bauman Moscow State Technical University received a gift from the Moscow city government: an architectural illumination of the main University buildings. The building ensemble of the Bauman MGTU in the Moscow neighbourhood of Lefortovo was constructed over many years. The main building of the University consists of several parts forming a square. One of the four facades faces a small park on 2nd Baumanskaya street, and the opposite facade opens onto the Yausa river near Lefortovskaya quay. Nearby on Rubtsovskaya quay the newest study-and-laboratory building of the MGTU is situated. The above three buildings and the small park were equipped with installations of architectural illumination, the design and mounting of which was done by Svetoservis Open Company workers.

AU  - Mikadze, V.
T2  - Landscape Research
AB  - This short research paper discusses the potential for understanding Guerrilla Gardening—a practice that creates informal and illegal green areas in urban environments—as a practice that both appropriates urban space and renders it public on the grounds of temporality, hybridity and humility. Guerrilla Gardening achieves this kind of publicness through the creation of an ephemeral landscape that both overlaps the existing programme of a space and makes rules and representations that it communicates visible and available for analysis. The paper offers a preliminary descriptive analysis of the practice and discusses the importance of linking the research on Guerrilla Gardening to the subjects of power and public space. This paper also proposes a phenomenological approach to understanding Guerrilla Gardening as a spatial practice through which individuals express their need for dwelling and caring by the means of recreating urban space. © 2014 Landscape Research Group Ltd.

TI  - Seasonal patterns of habitat selection of the House Sparrow Passer domesticus in the urban landscape of Valencia (Spain)
AU  - Murgui, E.
T2  - Journal of Ornithology
AB  - The habitat selection and the factors influencing the distribution of the House Sparrow Passer domesticus in the municipality of Valencia (76 km2) were studied during the winter and breeding season. House Sparrows positively selected urban parks and gardens, patches of derelict land and horticultural fields; they avoided the built-up habitat and the orange groves. In the urban landscape, the abundance of sparrows peaked in areas providing intermediate cover of the built-up habitat; it was positively driven by the amount of park land per unit area, and negatively by the size of urban parks. Our results suggest that the conservation and habitat enhancement of even the smallest parks and gardens are likely key factors in addressing the decline of the House Sparrow in many cities. © Dt.

TI  - Use of spatial features by foraging insectivorous bats in a large urban landscape
AU  - Avila-Flores, R.

T2  - Journal of Mammalogy
AB  - We analyzed the patterns of habitat use by insectivorous bats in Mexico City, one of the largest and most populated cities of the world. We tested the hypotheses that richer patches of food, expected in more vegetated areas, have higher bat activity levels, and that fast-flying species benefit most from urbanization. We compared activity of insectivorous species and relative abundance of insects in 5 habitats (large parks, small parks, illuminated open areas, residential areas, and natural forest). Sampling of bat activity and insects was conducted every 2 weeks in 12 sites per habitat during summer 2002. Measures of bat activity were based on 3,600 one-minute sequences of sound that were recorded and analyzed. The average number of taxa per site was significantly higher in the natural forest than in urban habitats, but overall bat activity was significantly higher in large parks and illuminated open areas than in small parks, residential areas and natural forest. Vespertilionid bats (Eptesicus fascus, Myotis, and an unidentified species), along with Eumops perotis, occurred almost exclusively in extensive green areas (large parks or natural forest). The molossid Nyctinomops macrotis made the broadest use of the urban-natural mosaic, whereas Tadarida brasiliensis used urban sites (illuminated areas and large parks) more intensively. Insect abundance was higher in large parks and natural forest, and it was significantly correlated with overall bat activity and with the number of taxa recorded per site. The observed patterns of habitat use and foraging can be explained by considering the flight and echolocation performance of species. Although some species successfully exploited highly urbanized sites, large areas with vegetation are needed to maintain the most diverse insectivorous bat fauna in Mexico City. © 2005 American Society of Mammalogists.

TI  - An anthropology of urbanism: How people make places (and what designers and planners might learn from it)
AU  - Wortham-Galvin, B.D.
T2  - Footprint
AB  - In their word play on what design praxis might succeed the New Urbanism movement in the United States, the July 2013 article "Newest Urbanism" in the Architect introduced to the uninitiated the concept of tactical urbanism. Defining tactical urbanism as "temporary, cheap, and usually grassroots interventions-including so-called guerrilla gardens, pop-up parks, food carts, and 'open streets' projects-that are designed to improve city life on a block-by-block, street-by-street basis," the article claims that it took this approach to shaping the city less than a decade to mainstream into the practices of US cities and firms alike. While Architect used the term tactical urbanism, to characterize this effort, this essay will use the term participatory urbanism to discuss how ordinary people are engaged in making place. This discussion of participatory urbanism will: describe the context from which it emerged in the United States, define the term and its current manifestations, and describe an early example of participatory urbanism seeded by digital tools in order to raise questions about participatory urbanism role in the making of place in the twenty-first century.

TI  - The improvisional city: Valuing urbanity beyond the chimera of permanence
AU  - Till, K.E.
AU  - McArdle, R.
T2  - Irish Geography
AB  - So-called temporary uses of urban space, including ‘pop ups’ or meanwhile spaces, have recently attracted much attention by urban professionals as providing short-term ‘solutions’ to the ‘problem’ of vacancy. Yet the ways in which these urban innovations are conceived, studied and evaluated continue to reify a capitalist framework of development and conceptual understanding of the city that valorises exchange value and permanence. The result is that little empirical research exists about smaller projects that offer the city and its residents many non-monetary benefits. In this article, we argue that evaluating urban space according to the dichotomy of permanent or temporary land use is problematic: it misses the fluidity and multiple rhythms of how places are made and spaces experienced that are inherent to the regular life of any city. Rather than temporary use, we use the concept of ‘interim space’ to consider projects that may be responsive to local needs and available resources. Such initiatives often include ‘non-visible’ advantages which stem from use values, healthy place-making and creating shared spaces, offer alternative economies, and provide residents and guests with new ways of imagining their neighbourhood and city. To make our arguments, we analyse Granby Park, a ‘pop up’ park in north Dublin, initiated by the artistic collective Upstart that was open to the public in the summer of 2013, using qualitative research conducted before, during and after the official time the park was open. To begin a conversation about new frameworks of analysis that might capture the intricacies of interim urban spaces such as Granby Park, we conclude by offering a new concept, the ‘improvisional city’, to encourage more empirical research that takes seriously the many tangible and intangible benefits of these initiatives. © 2015 Geographical Society of Ireland.

T2  - Ecology (CSSR)
AB  - Species richness, density, relative frequency of species, morphological similarity, foraging niche width and overlap measured on foraging sites of woodpecker and songbird communities were analysed in 2 original and 8 secondary Central European habitats in the Pilis UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and its vicinity c40 km from Budapest. The lowest species number and the highest extinction rate were in maize fields and small urban parks. The value of the average niche width is higher than that of the average niche overlap in original forest and large parks. The relationship between niche width and overlap is reversed in the secondary habitats except the large park. The foraging guilds are represented by few species and smaller values of morphological similarity in secondary habitats. In oak and locust-tree forests, when temperature is <0°C, and the soil is covered by snow, average niche width and overlap are lower than when temperature is >0°C, without snow. This situation is reversed in gardens and urban parks. -from Authors

AB  - A total of 93 species were reported, 50 of these were found to breed. In individual areas the number of breeding species varied from 17-39. Columba palumbus, Pica pica, Oriolus oriolus, Parus major and Fringilla coelebs were found breeding in all areas. 23 species were dominants, making up >5% of a total population. Included most often among these dominants were Streptopelia decaocto, Sturnus vulgaris, Hippolais icterina and Carduelis chloris. Density of breeding pairs varied from 46.5 per 10 ha (in a cemetery on the periphery) to 238.5 per 10 ha (in a small park in the city). Of the total number of breeding pairs in all areas, some 54% were of species nesting in the tree canopy and a height of >1.5m in shrubs and bushes. Hole-nesting species were poorly represented (30% of breeding pairs). -from Author

TI  - Experiments and Control Actions by Ultra‐low Volume Spraying Against Forest Pests
AU  - SCHINDLER, U.
T2  - EPPO Bulletin
AB  - The results obtained in experimental ULV‐applications of insecticides with portable knapsack sprayers and helicopters during 1967–1971, were mostly good. The method proved technically practicable and the biological effect was often better than with conventional spraying because with ULV‐application, more small droplets are deposited on the insects. The recommended quantities per hectare for 3 active ingredients against some species of sucking insects, beetles and larvae of butterflies and sawflies are listed in table 1. As regards eventual harmful side‐effects, care and the use of materials with low toxicity are recommended. Because of the possible drift of the mostly about 50μ droplets, the ULV‐method is of use in large woods in Central Europe but cannot be recommended for small parks and especially not near agricultural land, orchards and vineyards. Also, ULV‐spraying should not be applied, where people gather mushrooms and berries and where bees are kept. So far, no side‐effects specific to ULV‐application, as opposed to conventional spraying, are known. Some important advantages of the ULV‐method are the following: an enormous reduction in the number of take‐off and landing operations, resulting in greater safety for the pilots, aircraft payloads provide for greater coverage, no water or oil diluents are required (this is important if the water supply sets problems), there is no need for water tankers and mixing machines, so that storage and transport costs are greatly reduced (Simon, 1966, 1969). Expériences et campagnes de lutte contre les ravageurs forestiers au moyen de pulvérisations ULV Les résultats obtenus avec les essais d'application ULV d'insecticides effectués de 1967 à 1971 à l'aide de pulvérisateurs à dos et en épandage à partir d'hélicoptères ont été assez satisfaisants. La méthode s'est révélée techniquement praticable et son efficacité biologique a été souvent meilleure que celle des traitements classiques, ce qui s'explique par le fait qu'avec les procédés ULV un plus grand nombre de fines gouttelettes se dépose sur les insectes. Des recommandations ont pu être établies concernant le dosage à l'hectare de produits ULV à base de malathion, de diméthoate et de bromophos‐éthyl pour la lutte contre certaines espèces d'insectes suceurs, de coléoptères et de larves de lépidoptères et de tenthrèdes (cf. tableau 1). Ces chiffres, que reproduit le tableau 1, varient sous l'influence des qualités systémiques des produits, de la sensibilité de différentes espèces et de leurs stades évolutifs, ainsi que de la hauteur et de la densité des forêts (cf. tableau 2). L'essai de lutte le plus important, effectué par hélicoptère, a été dirigé contre Coleophora laricella Hbn. (cf. tableau 3). En ce qui concerné la lutte contre les cryptogames, Lophodermium pinastri (Schrad.) Chev. par exemple, les émultions ULV appropriées font encore défaut. En désherbage, le 2,4,5‐T concentré a donné de bons résultats, mais avec de tels produits le problème des dégâts par dérive se pose de façon plus aiguë. Pour contrecarrer le risque d'éventuels effets secondaires indésirables, les traitements doivent être appliqués avec le plus grand soin en utilisant, de préférence, des produits de faible toxicité. Etant donné la forte probabilité de dérive des gouttelettes, dont la plupart ne mesurent que 50μ, les techniques ULV, qui trouvent une application utile pour le traitement de larges étendues forestières en Europe centrale, sont au contraire à déconseiller dans de petits parcs et surtout à proximité des terres cultivées, des vergers et des vignobles; il faudrait les proscrire également aux endroits visités par les chercheurs de champignons ou de petits fruits, et là où l'on se consacre à l'apiculture. Parmi les avantages que présente la méthode ULV, les plus importants sont les suivants: nombre de décollages et atterrissages considérablement réduit, ce qui améliore la sécurité des pilotes; accroissement de la capacité de l'aéronef quant à la superficie traitée; diminution très sensible des frais de stockage et de transport par la suppression de l'emploi d'eau ou de diluants huileux, et partant, de camions‐citernes ou de machines de malaxage.

TI  - Recuperacion de pesquerias en un parque marino de arrecife coralino
AU  - McClanahan, T.R.

T2  - Conservation Biology
AB  - Numbers of fish and their wet weights were estimated in Kenyan coral- reef lagoons on seven reefs over 6 years. Two sites were protected from fishing for over 20 years, whereas the other five sites were heavily fished in recent years. A heavily fished site was converted into a marine park (Mombasa Marine National Park, approximately 10 km2, no fishing allowed), and the number of fishers allowed was slowly decreased between August 1991 and August 1992. The area adjacent to the park was converted into a marine reserve (only fishing traps, lines, and gill nets allowed) that provided fishing grounds for fishers excluded from the park. Data from a fish-landing site adjacent to the newly created marine park were collected for 3 years and analyzed to determine the effect of the park's creation on fish catches. Results suggest that fishing in the reserve reduced fish wet weight by about a factor of 10 and reduced fish numbers and species richnes by a factor of two. Both field studies and landing data suggest harvesting at a bionomic equilibrium. For example, approximately 65% of the landing site's fishing grounds were protected with the creation of the park, and 65% of the fishers quit the studied landing, leaving nearly the same density of fishers in the remaining area (~12 fishers/km2). Further, fishers using pull seines were excluded from the reserve, and their numbers were replaced by fishers using other gear (mostly basket traps). Although the overall catch per unit effort increased by about 110% after the park's creation, the total fish landed decreased by 35% and the catch per unit effort decreased toward the end of the study period despite increasing fish abundance in the park. Although establishment of small parks elsewhere have increased the total catch, the large park we studied did not; one reason may have been the lower ratio of edge to park area of the large park. Alternatively, the park's edge may have provided a good fishing area, so fishing effort may have been highest along the park's edge. Consequently, a barrier may have been created that restricted fish dispersal to most of the reserve. Therefore, the area that had an increased catch was small (< 1 to 2 km from the edge) and could not compensate for the lost fishing area. Most fish species within the park showed recovery after fisher exclusion. Total fish wet weights 3 years after the fisher's exclusion were 25% below the older marine parks. Poor recovery of the herbivorous parrol and surgeonfish can account for much of this shortfall. Competition for resources with sea urchins appear to be slowing recovery of these two groups. A study site 2.5 km from the park's southern boundary, in the reserve section of the protected area, showed no changes in fish abundance over the study period, despite changing gear regulations.

AB  - America’s need for open space has become a widespread and popular concern, if not a faddish one. The purposes served by open space are varied and occasionally conflicting. They include conserving wildlife habitats or providing areas for outdoor recreation, providing small neighborhood parks in developed areas or containing urban sprawl by securing large areas, controlling growth, or preserving historic areas. Individuals dedicated to any one purpose may remain largely unconcerned about others. One goal of open space conservation whose necessity has produced little conflict is the preservation of agricultural land. The conflict in this area centers instead on its implementation. © 1977 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Regional analysis of mammal distributions among Canadian parks: implications for park planning
AU  - Glenn, S.M.
T2  - Canadian Journal of Zoology
AB  - Within "mammal provinces' of Canada, several parks supported the same number of mammalian species, or more, than a single large park with the same area. The proportion of species that require undisturbed habitats increased with total area conserved. Human disturbances should be reduced in parks because these undisturbed-site species are unable to survive in disturbed environments not protected by a park system. Not all small parks had the same composition. The author thus recommends establishing many parks in a biologically defined region and incorporating as much total area as possible. To aid in developing a strategy for placing parks across Canada, areas with high total mammalian richness and high richness of mammal species intolerant of disturbances are highlighted. -from Author

AB  - Using range maps depicting mammal distributions in Canada prior to European settlement, species-area curves with confidence limits were constructed for each of 6 regions where species composition of mammals was faunistically homogeneous. Number of species in parks was compared to the number predicted to have been present in an area of equivalent size during the pre-settlement era. In the densely populated region compsiring S Ontario, S Quebec, and the Maritimes, and consistent with predictions from island biogeography theory, parks presently have fewer species that require undisturbed habitats than were predicted to have been present prior to settlement. The difference between the number of species observed and predicted is greater for small parks. In all other regions, most parks had the same or more species than predicted. Greater numbers of species in some parks may be due either to alteration of habitats (eg fire suppression in prairie parks) or siting parks in species-rich areas. -Authors

AB  - The NPS has always used a totally integrated approach to remote sensing and GIS. GIS techniques have been used in image processing to improve classifications, while results of image processing classifications have been used in GIS analyses. In terms of acreage, approximately three quarters of the total acreage within the NPS is being worked on in this manner. The use of satellite data has become the method of choice to very efficiently and cost effectively develop vegetation/landcover information for medium to large NPS areas. However, with the advent of the ability to merge high resolution SPOT panchromatic with Landsat TM, satellite data may also become the method of choice for small park areas. -from Author

AB  - Amalgamates the findings of many studies of people/environment interactions in the US. Included is information pertaining to 7 types of urban space: urban plazas; neighborhood parks; miniparks and vest-pocket parks; campus outdoor spaces; housing and outdoor spaces for the elderly; day care outdoor spaces; and hospital outdoor spaces. Each chapter starts with an introduction to and definition of the type of open space being discussed, followed by a review of the literature on this spatial form, design guidelines and short case studies. The reason for these case studies is to present actual settings and to describe how they function in relation to the issues raised. -from Editors

AB  - The need to retrofit some older buildings of historical significance is discussed and the standards demanded for public buildings by the Ministry of Works and Development (New Zealand) and for commercial and other buildings by the Wellington City Council (WCC) are compared. Commercial and economic considerations have led to the WCC's current intention to require 1175 buildings throughout the rest of Wellington City to be brought to at least 1935 standards, or about 2/3 of current practice. Small parks in the central business district provide open space in the City, safe places for assembly from falling masonry, as well as helicopter access in emergencies.

TI  - Chicago's waterfalls
T2  - Civil Engineering
AB  - The 1994 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award goes to successful implementation of an elegantly simple idea: aerate sluggish water by letting it fall through man-made waterfalls placed off-stream in small parks. The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago calls its project SEPA--sidestream elevated pool aeration. Reviewing alternatives to the in-stream installations, MWRDGC engineers looked for a system that could be operated only when needed, be off-stream, be acceptable to the adjacent communities, be cost-effective, and be simple to operate and maintain without obstructing water traffic or recreation. The engineers arrived at the waterfall plan in 1984; their feasibility report won state approval in 1987.

AB  - To provide information on the ecology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nature, bacteriological surveillance was performed in the defined area in Hokkaido, Japan. P. aeruginosa was isolated from water samples of Ushubetsu River in the down stream from the urban area of Asahikawa. P. aeruginosa was isolated from fecal samples of pigs but not from samples of soil of a tomato field, sand of sandboxes in vest-pocket parks, fresh vegetables, or feces of wild deer. The present results indicate that P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the river water is originated from the environment of human activity and not from wild life or domestic animals.

TI  - Evaluating the contribution of Small National Park areas to regional biodiversity
AU  - Falkner, M.B.
AU  - Stohlgren, T.J.
T2  - Natural Areas Journal
AB  - Conservationists have questioned whether setting aside small national parks and reserves for conservation is an effective approach to maintaining regional diversity. We summarized the available information on the species richness of vascular plants, mammals, and birds for 44 U.S. National Park System units in the Rocky Mountain Region. Species richness increased as park area increased (Species number = 246 + (102*log Area); r2 = 0.48; P < 0.005). However, species density (species km-2) showed a negative relationship with area (log Species number/km2=5.5 - (0.8*log Area); r2 = 0.94; P < 0.001). Due to species composition differences among park units, small units and a considerable number of species to regional species lists. Differences in species composition (measured as percent overlap) had a negative relationship with increasing distance from the target park-Yellowstone National Park-ranging from 7% to 54%. The number of species reported as unique to a unit varied considerably by unit and by taxon; this is because several units cover a wider range of habitats than occur in a single large reserve of comparable size. We used species-area curves to estimate that the establishment of a new 100 km2 reserve would include 718 species to the reserve system. Adding the same size area to an existing small, medium, and large reserve would only add 35, 7, and 1 species, respectively. Most small parks in the region were initially established as cultural/historical sites, yet our results illustrate the role of the smaller National Park System units as biological refugia, migration/dispersal rest stops and corridors, and living outreach programs. Small units have a disproportionate share of regional biodiversity and an understand role in the conservation of biodiversity in the region.

TI  - The long road to rebuilding Lower Manhattan
AU  - Langdon, P.
T2  - Planning
AB  - The elements that planners and designers frequently cite as principal elements in a successful reconstruction of the Trade Center site and revitalization of downtown include these: A grid of streets replacing the windswept Trade Center superblock. "The Trade Center repelled people," says Yaro. "In the years that I had an office near there, I can't remember a single time that I walked over there just to hang out and have a sandwich. It was oppressive." Today, there's a much greater emphasis on appealing streetscapes, small parks, and courtyards. Office buildings considerably lower than the twin towers. Yaro notes that World Trade Center had a floor area ratio of 14, whereas the section of Midtown north of Grand Central Station has a floor area ratio of 16. This indicates, he says, that the rebuilding can accommodate as much development as before, even without super tall towers. As a practical matter, very tall towers are more expensive to build. And who would now rent an office on the 102nd floor? More housing, mixed uses, and amenities. Midtown has thrived as a business location partly because it has plenty of executive-level and middle-class housing nearby and because it has an array of public amenities, including Central Park, theaters, and cultural life. Will Lower Manhattan be able to compete? Improved transportation. Midtown has benefited greatly from Grand Central Station, the commuters' gateway.

AU  - Baker, W.L.

AU  - Hessl, A.E.
T2  - Ecography
AB  - National parks face problems in managing wild ungulates and their forage resources, including small park sizes and incomplete protection of winter ranges, absence of major predators, and influences from exterior management activities. Our study focuses on the effects of elk Cervus elaphus browsing on aspen Populus tremuloides in the elk winter range of Rocky Mountain National Park. Elk can prevent successful regeneration of aspen by suckers, and increase the mortality of established trees. Here we quantify the effect of elk on aspen in the elk winter range of the park, particularly since the adoption of a policy of 'natural regulation' in 1968. We collected a stratified-random sample of aspen cohorts in the elk winter range, and also inside two long-term exclosures. In each cohort we tallied live and dead trees by diameter, recorded the height and percentage of stem surface covered by bark-stripping, and estimated the date of regeneration of the cohort using increment cores. We also tallied live and dead aspen suckers (young trees <2.5 m tall) by height and the number of live and dead branches on each sucker. Aspen outside the exclosures are declining as evidenced by: 1) high mortality among established trees, including entire stands that are dead, 2) low density of live suckers, insufficient to regenerate the stand, 3) suckers that are excessively branched and seldom surviving to reach tree height, and 4) almost no cohort regeneration since adoption of natural regulation. Exclosures and early photos of the elk winter range suggest these are anomalous conditions. Over the last century, aspen cohorts regenerated only when there were fewer than ca 600 elk on the park's elk winter range, far fewer than the present estimated 1600 head. Fire suppression, natural succession, fluctuations in beaver populations, climatic fluctuations, and other factors are of no or lesser importance than elk ill the regeneration and survival of aspen cohorts on the elk winter range. The decline of aspen is a concern when management is focused on the ecosystem scale rather than simply the scale of wildlife and their primary forage resources.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - The study of ungulate populations in south Asia has lagged behind comparable efforts in Africa. The need for intensive study of Asian wildlife communities is critical. The existing data concerning the numbers and habitat needs of selected mammalian herbivores in south Asia are reviewed. It is concluded that special attention must be given to those species of ungulates which appear to exploit early to mid-succession vegetation stages. These species are especially vulnerable to decline in small parks and reserves where vegetational succession can move rapidly to a climax condition. The ungulate fauna of south Asia is unique and generalisations based on studies in Africa are not necessarily applicable to the subcontinent. The Cervidae emerge as an important radiation in Asia with extensive adaptation to browsing niches. © 1976.

AB  - In recent years high-resolution numerical simulation of surface-plant-air interactions as an important part of global circulation models (GCM) or as a tool to assist in planning decisions has experienced increased consideration. In contrast large scale phenomena described in GCMs, the lower part of the atmosphere where we live is very sensitive to small scale processes which can develop an individual local climate, different to the expected average conditions. Especially in urban areas the great variety of different surfaces and sheltering obstacles produces a pattern of distinct microclimate systems. To simulate these local effects, microscale surface-plant-air interaction schemes with a special extension to typical artificial urban boundaries are needed. The paper focuses on the microscale numerical simulation of surface-plant-air interactions inside urban structures, especially the feedback between artificial surfaces like buildings and vegetation inside street canyons, backyards or greens. The three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model ENVI-met is presented and used to solve the basic equations forward in time and can simulate 'hard' wind field modifications (solid boundaries) like walls as well as 'soft' modifications (porous shelters) like vegetation. A case study of building a small park inside the CBD area will show what effects even small changes can have on local flow and temperature fields.; In recent years high-resolution numerical simulation of surface-plant-air interactions as an important part of global circulation models (GCM) or as a tool to assist in planning decisions has experienced increased consideration.

AB  - Habitat subdivision by geography or human activity may be an important determinant of regional species richness. Cumulative species-area relationships for vertebrates, land plants, and insects on island archipelagoes show that collections of small islands generally harbor more species than comparable areas composed of one or a few large islands. The effect of the degree of habitat subdivision in increasing species richness appears to increase with the distance from potential sources of colonists. Mountaintop biotas show no clear differences between species richness on large alpine areas and collections of smaller peaks. National park faunas generally have more species in collections of small parks than in the larger parks. In all cases where a consistent effect of subdivision is observed, the more subdivided collection of islands or isolates contains more species. To the degree that these data provide guidance for establishing nature reserves, they suggest that increasing the numbers of reserves may be an important component of conservation strategies. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - The Pocket Park and Its Impact on the Quality of Urban Space on the Local and Supralocal Scale-Case Study of Krakow, Poland
AU  - Bajwoluk, T
AU  - Langer, P
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The idea of building pocket parks in cities is one of the more rational proposals for utilizing cameral spaces to create new quality in terms of green areas while accounting for the potential to blend them into the compact functiospatial structure of the contemporary city. Numerous examples of pocket park projects from around the world point to there being considerable interest in this form of greenery. The goal of this paper is to present the findings of a study of a selected number of pocket parks in Krakow, Poland, in terms of their accessibility, local determinants, and the nearby functiospatial structure, as well as whether they can be included into a wider network of service and green spaces of supralocal significance. The research method included novel field research of selected pocket parks and their surroundings. The form and function of the parks were analyzed and the type of their surrounding urban structure was determined, along with the parks' accessibility. The study investigated nine parks located in the northeastern part of Krakow in a dense development structure dominated by multi-family housing. Analyses of the parks themselves and the research on the relations and linkages between parks and their surrounding urban structure generally pointed to the accuracy of the concept of the pocket park, its universality, and its compliance with the concept of the sustainable development of urban space. The presence and manner of development of pocket parks can be said to enhance the quality of spaces in confined fragments of an urban structure and to have predominantly local significance.

AB  - Time's Up! is a New York environmental group which promotes non-polluting transportation and sustainable solutions to urban problems. Over the last twenty-five years, the group has taken a do-it-yourself approach to environmental activism, bridging neighborhood, global justice, and Occupy movements. With roots in the squatter movement in New York, Time's Up! has built its own distinct brand of DIY urbanism to fight for community gardens, support group bike rides, and create sustainable approaches to urban living. While the group makes use of a wide range of approaches to reclaim public space, direct action is its guiding principle. The group links social networks with alternative approaches to community building outside of institutional channels. The following considers Time's Up! as a case study in environmental justice DIY urbanism. (C) 2014 by The Transformative Studies Institute. All rights reserved.

T2  - DIGITAL URBAN ACUPUNCTURE: HUMAN ECOSYSTEMS AND THE LIFE OF CITIES IN THE AGE OF COMMUNICATION, INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE
AB  - In this chapter we will understand how to use the Relational Ecosystem to perform Digital Urban Acupuncture. The chapter starts off from the definition of Urban Acupuncture, and from all its supporting theories and methodologies, to then define Digital Urban Acupuncture: its goals, methodological approach, assumptions, and operative strategies. By considering the city as an ecosystem, it is possible to take into consideration the myriads of microhistories of all of its members to identify flows of information, communication, knowledge, emotion, opinion, activation, and their patterns over geography and time. These can be used to highlight the pressure points, just as in acupuncture, which can be activated to creatively provoke engagement, interconnection, relation, and the breaking of undesired loops and patterns. This allows for both a dynamic definition-and polyphonic-of the well-being of the city, and to activate the identified pressure points in creative ways, to provoke wide results, affecting wide areas of the population. A final section of this chapter explores the issues connected to the multiple forms of divide which can be present in this scenario, and possible ways in which it is possible to confront with them: digital divides, cultural divides, age divides, and more. The chapter ends with an interview with Marco Casagrande.

AU  - Corrales, EPC
T2  - ENTORNO GEOGRAFICO
AB  - The paper exposes an intervention proposal for an urban park in the city of Latacunga, Cotopaxi (Ecuador). The potential intervention seeks to promote the appropriation of public space where people and future users act as protagonists of the change, by contributing ideas and initiatives to create a place that considers their opinions, needs and suggestions. In order to achieve this, the proposal used the Wayfinder methodology, an avant-garde approach that assesses, plans, and acts in social-ecological systems to achieve sustainable, safe and fair transformations. Likewise, it proposes tactical urbanism activities as practical strategies to accomplish the project's objective. The paper concludes that an intervention of this type is viable and capable of generating outstanding results regarding urban public space appropriation. Being viable, it is established that it can be executed in the short term, in accordance with the guidelines presented in the text.

T2  - TRIA-TERRITORIO DELLA RICERCA SU INSEDIAMENTI E AMBIENTE
AB  - Water like food is an indispensable resource which is essential for our daily existence. The construction of canals was motivated by the wide range of activities it can perform, ranging from irrigation, storm-water management, transportation to sewage disposal. Apart from these, canals also served in keeping the micro climate in check while giving a pleasant aesthetic appeal to the area.
India has had an extensive canal network most of which were laid by the British for their own benefit. However, post-independence with rapid urbanization over time these canals have not only lost their identity but also the purpose for which it was built. Most of them lie neglected, choked with effluents that are hazardous for human health. The situation is only worsening as the country is facing more and more shortage of clean water. This paper is an attempt towards understanding the need for integrating an urban canal front with the city to increase the vitality of the surrounding areas and generate utilitarian public spaces alongside safeguarding the urban environment. A study on Urban Acupuncture, a relatively modern concept in conjunction to Canal-Oriented Development facilitates in the assemblage of diverse interpretations pertaining to the implementation of design ideas at site level. Owing to its small scale, budget friendly localized interventions urban acupuncture plays a decisive role in addressing the minuscule yet substantial issues concerning the canal precincts. An overview of Beliaghata Canal has been discussed to further the discussion on integrating an urban canal front with the urban fabric incorporating urban acupuncture with respect to local context..

AU  - Aziz, NAA
T2  - LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE FRONTIERS
AB  - Decoding the relationship between crime and place has been the focus of researchers in both design and social fields for a few decades. Space syntax theory offers the possibility of examining the configuration characteristics of the environment and their potential influences on people's activities and crime patterns; however, its implementation in landscape architecture has been limited. This study responds to such a gap by exploring the effectiveness of applying space syntax theory to predict safety levels in a park in Cairo, Egypt. depthmapX was used to analyze the spatial configuration of the park. Crime records from 2019 were collected through site observation and staff interviews, and analyzed using ArcGIS 10.3 software. Results indicated a strong correlation between space depth / integration / connectivity and crime pattern distribution. The park visibility graphs indicated the different impacts of vegetation (evergreen tree / deciduous trees' in summer and winter on visual connectivity and crime types. The research concluded that applying space syntax theory to landscape architecture is challenging; nevertheless, it represents a promising approach to predict committing crimes in urban parks, and the findings can be adopted to enhance park conceptual designs to achieve higher safety level.

AU  - Kinder, K
T2  - WHY DETROIT MATTERS: DECLINE, RENEWAL AND HOPE IN A DIVIDED CITY
A3  - Doucet, B
AB  - After several chapters focusing on the context and structural forces shaping Detroit, we now shift toward understanding how residents live under such conditions. In Chapter Five, Joshua Akers critiqued current strategies of blight remediation. In this chapter, Kimberley Kinder examines strategies local residents employ to manage the disinvestment seen in their neighborhoods, including blight. Her chapter focuses on the concept of "do-it-yourself[ DIY] urbanism." Rather than celebrating this process, as others have done, Kinder situates the struggle of self-provisioning in wider national and global trends of economic restructuring and neoliberal policymaking. In contrast to Akers, Kinder demonstrates that purchasing foreclosed properties at auction is one of the DIY strategies used to help prevent further neighborhood decline.
Using examples from her vast empirical research, Kinder illustrates three ways in which DIY urbanism transforms the urban environment: rearranging people in space, renegotiating access to resources, and reshaping ethical norms. This last point is important because many DIY practices are illegal (such as entering into an abandoned home to remove items that might make it conducive for drug dealing). To deal with this, residents adopt a position of ethical relativism, which she defines as "conforming to locally negotiated rules of action that technically violated municipal law while nonetheless maintaining social legitimacy."
DIY urbanism and self-provisioning are common practice for many Detroiters and a recurring theme throughout this book. The community garden of Wayne Curtis and Myrtle Thompson-Curtis (Chapter Twenty-two) or the work of the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network (Chapter Eighteen) provide fresh and healthy food to neighborhoods no longer served by grocers from mainstream capitalism; the Boggs School (Chapter Twenty-three) offers quality, place-based education in the absence of a strong local school district. Such initiatives fit within Grace Lee Boggs' (Chapter Twenty-five) vision of revolution and share the idea that citizens and communities need to take power over their situation because the formal systems of government, services, and investment either do not exist or do not cater to their needs (for perspectives of how racism contributes to this, see the conversations with Malik Yakini, Chapter Eighteen, and Yusef Bunchy Shakur, Chapter Twenty-four). Kinder's chapter also reminds us that it is not just community leaders or activists who engage in DIY urbanism; ordinary residents are often central to these transformations.
Kimberley Kinder is an Assistant Professor of Urban Planning at the University of Michigan. She is the author of the recently released book, DIY Detroit: Making Do in a City Without Services (Kinder, 2016). Her first book, The Politics of Urban Water: Changing Waterscapes in Amsterdam (University of Georgia Press) was published in 2015.

A3  - Bracken, G
AB  - During the eleventh century, literati of the Song Empire (960-1279) tried, for the first time, to capture the experience of urban space in writing. Rather than a purely literary experiment, this effort constituted part of an attempt to discern a universal moral pattern in the apparent chaos of city life. Whoever succeeded in representing the city in a manner that was both accurate and coherent, both comprehensive and dynamic, would thereby demonstrate a complete understanding of economic activity, the necessary basis for perfect governance and lasting order. Because money and commerce brought to urban residents the goods they required to survive, literati reasoned that money and commerce must be beneficent, and because they were beneficent, they must conform to natural principles, as all that was enduringly sustaining of life and well-being must be rooted in nature. And because money and commerce conformed to a natural pattern, the city must function like a living organism. In the 1030s and 1040s, literati were confident that they stood near the discovery of this enduring moral pattern, and to the restoration of the perfect governance of antiquity. By the end of the eleventh century, however, their hopes were defeated through violent debate. In exile and retirement, discouraged men began to seek the pattern of all things in themselves rather than in society, and resolved to establish moral order in their family and community rather than throughout the empire. This endeavour turned them back toward the countryside, away from the city. A literary and intellectual history of the city in the eleventh century thus traces a shift in the care of the self, from an ambition of securing the prosperous health of the empire and its subjects through universal policy, to an attempt to approach universal truth through individual cultivation and local action.

TI  - Social sustainability: Do-it-yourself urbanism, start-it-yourself urbanism
AU  - Bafarasat, AZ

T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - Many definitions of social sustainability focus on community engagement and economic equity as the main determinants of social sustainability. Measures to achieve social sustainability need to address (a) poverty, and (b) poverty-generating mechanisms or social and political exclusion. Governments do not take adequate steps toward social sustainability. Self-help actions of communities are an alternative route to social sustainability. Self-help actions have three main features: community leadership, focus on short-term implementation, and limited resources. Do-it-yourself (DIY) urbanism often refers to the self-help actions of communities to meet their basic needs like shelter by making changes in the urban space without government permission and resources. DIY urbanism is helpful to social sustainability more in the Global South, but it has limitations in the meaningful addressing of poverty. Start-it-yourself (SIY) urbanism refers to the 'start' of self-help actions (or their gesture) by communities but with the intention to pressure public and private bodies for permission and resources. SIY urbanism is helpful to social sustainability more in the Global North, but it has limitations in addressing poverty-generating mechanisms. This is because of some deals that SIY urbanism makes with public and private elites in exchange for resources to better address poverty impacts. However, we propose that SIY urbanism might be able to integrate the two aspects of social sustainability.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION
AB  - For the majority of Americans who live in urban areas, parks and other urban green spaces offer recreation environments that promote human health. To better understand how parks and urban green spaces enhance people's well-being, this study uses a cross-over field experiment design to analyze the impact of noise and danger on perceived restoration. Participants (N = 112) walked in a random order through two one -mile routes in natural (park) and artificial (street) envirmunents. Participants self-reported their levels of perceived restoration, noise, and danger after walking through each enviromnent.
Similar to previous studies, the natural (park) environment was perceived as significantly more restorative than the artificial (street) environment. Noise was a significant predictor of the significantly higher levels of perceived restoration. In contrast, although participants did perceive the artificial enviroment as more dangerous, this construct explained a relatively small amount of variation in perceived restoration and was not a significant predictor.
These results have implications for park agencies. In order to facilitate both physical activity and restoration opportunities for people recreating in parks, agencies should conserve and enhance the natural soundscape by maintaining and further developing sound buffering vegetation at the perimeter of parks. The effect of this landscaping could be enhanced by regulations minimizing the level of mechanical and human noise in the surrounding areas. Second, while repurposing city streets into temporary parks may offer excellent opportunities for outdoor physical activity, people recreating in such temporarily repurposed streets may experience less restoration than they would in a permanent park due to die relative absence of a natural acoustic envirmunent. Third, pocket parks and other small parks may not have enough buffering landscaping on the perimeter of the park to facilitate a natural soundscape within the park. Moreover, if small parks promote physical activity by encouraging people to walk to the park, then these parks may be leading people to walk in less restorative street enviromnents that are replete with mechanical and human noise. Finally, although everyone may not be seeking restoration, agencies should include information about the quality of the soundscape in their marketing material to help users find the acoustic environment that best meets their needs. Overall, this study suggests that agencies consider using landscape maintenance, regulation, park design, and education to facilitate and promote opportunities for outdoor recreationists to experience restoration in urban parks.

AB  - Smart growth is a new urbanism which promotes transit-oriented development to enhance the overall economic efficiency. Due to unruly urbanization, this approach emerges as a solution to build and maintain our towns and cities in a better way. The present paper tries to interrogate the intemperate urbanization and related issues as well as re-imaging Faridabad city towards smart growth approach and reconstruct newer fangled identities. This industrial city was once upon a time recognised as 'Manchester of India', being part of the National Capital Region, this metropolitan city experienced 13-fold increase in its level of urbanization since 1951. It faces challenges like accumulation of garbage, traffic congestion, deteriorating roads, pollution, and a strain on civic supplies like water, drainage and electricity. Globalization acts as a catalyst in reconstructing the city. In the post-industrial era, a decline in work-force participation rate over the decades is observed, due to the change in the economic character, from being predominantly primary and secondary, to tertiary and quaternary now. In real estate sector, it has launched its dream project 'Greater Faridabad'; it is now trying to attract IT as well as Biotech sectors so that international flow will support this city to revive again. Through various infrastructural projects and proposed Metrorail project between Gurgaon and Faridabad, this city will have world class infrastructure. This city is on a drive of smart growth.

Starting from the detection of approaches found in literature and the identification of international case studies, the essay focuses on a qualitative analysis of intervention models, proposing an evaluation matrix that identifies significant indicators to assess the effectiveness of projects over time. The evaluation matrix also takes advantage of the experience of a collective that promotes projects of public spaces through new forms of interaction between inhabitants and common goods.

As a temporary installation, the Pop-Up park was meant to enliven the existing park and encourage residents, employees, students, and visitors to spend time outside in the city. For downtown Camden, the Pop-up is an entirely new type of public space, meant as an experiment to guide future public space investment. Using time-lapse photography, the design team recorded how users interacted with the space. Data collection was used to see which elements of the park worked best, and which could be improved. Findings were summarized to guide future park improvements.

This research studies the relationship between graphic creativity and citizen participation for architectural and university applications in urban processes to build the city, and in the strategies and means to operate it In schools, this relationship reveals glimpses of new ways of alternative learning. As a research method, we analyze-examples that have influenced various graphic disciplines and technological implementations, and urban art practices that have emerged from citizen struggles. The results illustrate that the urban project can be taught by incorporating collaborative design, with strategies such as street art, collective maps or tactical urbanism, and urban sketching and virtual reality, taken together as means of enriching the creative, artistic and educational processes.

TI  - Educating Future Generations of Community Gardeners A Deweyan Challenge
AU  - Ralston, SJ
T2  - CRITICAL EDUCATION
AB  - In this paper, I formulate a Deweyan argument for school gardening that prepares students for a specific type of gardening activism: community gardening, or the political activity of collectively organizing, planting and tending gardens for the purposes of food security, education and community development. Though not identical, a related type of gardening activism, guerrilla gardening, or the political activity of reclaiming unused urban land, sometimes illegally, for purposes of cultivation and beautification, is also implicated. Historically, community gardening in the U.S. has been associated with relief projects during periods of economic downturn and crisis, urban blight and gentrification, as well as nationalism, nativism and racism. Despite these last few unfortunate associations, the American philosopher John Dewey detached school gardening from the nativist's tool-kit, portraying it as a gateway to more enriching adult experiences, not as a technique for assimilating immigrant children to a distinctly American way of life. One of those experiences that school gardening can prepare children for is environmental political activism, particularly involvement in gardening movements. Dewey did not mention this collateral benefit. Nevertheless, an argument can be made that garden advocacy-or, more specifically, participation in politically-motivated gardening movements-is an acceptable interpretation, or elaboration, of what Dewey meant by "a civic turn" to school gardening.

AB  - The issue of suburb regeneration is highly relevant today. Current urban planning approaches are mainly focused on large and permanent transformations. These solutions often do not take into account the great dynamism and rapid transformations of cities, making any intervention, in most cases, outdated even before its realisation. Nevertheless, these expensive interventions implemented by local government frequently tend to fail the regeneration of these public spaces. This chapter presents the experience of 'Serpentone reload', a workshop based on participatory reactivation of abandoned and underused spaces and buildings in the 'Cocuzzo/Serpentone' neighbourhood of Potenza in Basilicata, Italy. The workshop focussed particularly on the reuse of the 'Ship', an underground building completed in 2010 but never used because, since then, it has been perceived as an extraneous element, being the result of an imposition and not the outcome of shared choices. The aim of this chapter is to propose a methodology that will allow the reactivation of public spaces, the empowerment of communities and the increase in citizens' interest in planning choices, pointing therefore alternative ways for urban governance and for local government urban policies. The results show that the involvement of people in urban planning and in Placemaking activities raises the level of social cohesion, generating both social benefits and quality of public spaces.

AB  - Urban green spaces have recently gained a lot of attention, as they are known to provide various vital ecosystem services to the community. Bangalore, a south-Indian city, which was called the "Garden City" of India, has several large green spaces. It is only in recent years that small pocket green spaces such as neighborhood parks have been created. Although the importance of neighborhood parks is known, they are ignored and readily sacrificed for developmental projects, while the large heritage green spaces receive more attention and are conserved. The concept of the large spaces providing more services seems to have filtered into the minds of citizens, thus resulting in complete negligence towards the neighborhood parks. Cities are required to implement newer concepts which focus on small green spaces too, which could enhance the services they currently provide to the community. Thus integrating multiple concepts that not only focus on the ecological functioning but also the social needs of the community could help increase the stewardship which is currently lacking around neighborhood parks and much needed attention towards small green spaces. In this chapter, through an interdisciplinary approach, we suggest concepts that could help conserve smaller green spaces through better green space management in developing cities.

AB  - Hot and dry climate and air pollution is a growing problem in urban areas, and this can have an adverse impact on life and health of urban residents. One of the ways to protect people from this hazard is the use of urban green or street greenery. However, its implementation can be problematic in highly urbanized areas. This paper presents a concept of the green structure (GS), designed, and is still being developed, by Adam Kalinowski where cooling efficiency is based on the synergy of shade and evapotranspiration. The GS that could be used as street furniture, small architecture form or a public utility structure intended to protect people and objects from an adverse urban environment, at the same time providing pleasant and healthy microclimate inside. The pilot project-the first application of the GS in the urban environment-is presented and the results of short-term measurements of temperature and humidity are provided and analyzed. Moreover, a simple dynamic simulation of the GS performance in courtyards has been conducted. The obtained results show the decrease of the perceived temperature within this structure. Depending on climate type, an average potential reduction of Universal Thermal Comfort Index (UTCI) and mean radiant temperature (T-mrt), caused by the GS in a courtyard case study, is 5-8 degrees C and 17-29 degrees C, respectively. Performed simulation also confirms that TRNSYS software is an appropriate tool for simple outdoor microclimate analysis. Further research to develop this concept, increase its performance and customize it for different applications are proposed.

TI  - Mitigation Strategies of the Urban Heat Island Over Greater Cairo Metropolitan Area, Egypt Utilizing ENVI-Met Model
AU  - Hussein, MS
T2  - CATRINA-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - The formation of urban heat islands (UHI) over cities is the main challenge to the urban environmental sustainability worldwide. To mitigate UHI effects, passive cooling using cool materials and/or greening is thought to be the most effective strategy. As urban greening is relatively nascent in the urban literature, a multitude of research gaps are still to be filled, especially for the cities belonging to the hot arid belt. The present study aims to explore to what extent are three greening strategies (facade greening, roofs greening and urban parks) feasible in UHI mitigation using case study in Greater Cairo Metropolitan Area (GCMA). This task is best achieved through modeling, using the micro-scale numerical model ENVI-met, to simulate the probable outdoor cooling effects of greening for a hot summer day. The results, for this specific case, show that both facade and roof greening would yield up to 0.5 degrees C average reduction of air temperature compared with the actual case, while the cooling effects of the hypothetical pocket parks may be as high as 7 degrees C during day time till 15.00 PM, and after that parks would exhibit heat island properties. The study findings may assist in better planning of urban green spaces to increase their cooling potentialities.

AU  - Myeong, S
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Temperature is one of the main issues in climate change, and the urban heat island effect in highly developed urban areas is an important issue that we need to deal with. This study analyzed the extent of the cooling effects of urban green spaces. The study used a surface temperature map of Seoul. It found that the cooling effects of green space was observed within limited distances, although it varied a little depending on the parks investigated. The cooling effect distance ranged from 240m to 360m, averaging about 300m. It also found the size of an urban green space does not make much difference in cooling the surrounding areas. Although further investigation with diverse urban areas should be conducted on this matter, the results did imply that many small green spaces in the neighborhood are more effective than a single big green space in mitigating the heat island effects of cities.

AB  - Green city is a city seeking for transition from a traditional city paradigm to a sustainable city based on the principles of nature as circulation, coexistence and balance in a response to climate change. Cheongju City has been trying to find its identity as a green capital of Korea, and attempts to develop the policy packages to build the green capital in response to climate change. This study intends to analyze a transition master plan for the green city and to set policy priorities through governance. This study employs participatory approaches including focus group interviews, experts' advisory meetings, and survey. This study also develops indicators to evaluate the importance of the values of green city through an expert Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) survey method. Then, set policy priorities of green city based on the evaluation results. The vision and strategies were derived through consecutive group discussions between various stakeholders consisted of professors, NGOs, and local government officials for several months. The vision was composed of ten strategies, for example, building circular networks of local material and establishing community-based economic system etc. This study has set policy priorities based on the evaluation of green city's values of each policy. It is found that the top five policies were building Moosim-chon, river of life and citizens forests, diagnosis and innovation of administration system, mapping biotope and climate, operating car-free streets and building 1000 pocket parks.

T2  - MEGARON
AB  - The research presents a multi-criteria decision-making method that focuses on evaluating spatial performance by considering all areas without roads or structural elements as "urban surfaces". In this context, the Seyyid Omer neighbourhood in Istanbul's Fatih district, as the study area, was discussed in detail in terms of physical, ecological, and social criteria and their sub-criteria. While the physical criteria include the size of each area and enclosure; the ecological criteria were studied with permeability rates and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) value, which measures unit area through the amount of chlorophyll. In addition, the type of property and land use in the urban context, which are the main factors for citizens' interaction with open spaces, were included as sub-criteria under the main social criterion. The relationships between the identified criteria and the open space typologies in the neighbourhood were converted into an index using the analytical network process (ANP) to measure the urban surface performance. The developed index indicated that some urban voids stand out even more than the important ones and have greater potential than urban parks such as Cukur Bostan in terms of social and vegetation qualities. As a result of the research, a map of the importance level was created to illustrate the potential areas for improving the urban ecological performance. Then, various pocket parks such as Selaleli Park and Skate Park and urban voids regarding their physical, ecological and social values were extracted as potential urban open spaces. With this structure, the research proposes a multi-criteria index that can be used to evaluate the potential of urban surfaces by putting them on a multi-dimensional and computable scale.Cite this article as: SerdarYakutES, CenaniS, Cagdas G.

TI  - Evaluation of outdoor activities in residential environments: The role of urban open spaces
AU  - Ajayi, A
T2  - TOWN AND REGIONAL PLANNING
AB  - There is increasing evidence linking the availability of urban open spaces to improve active living and outdoor behaviour. However, it is not clear what typologies of urban open spaces stimulate what types of activities. This article explores outdoor utilisation of open spaces in residential neighbourhoods of Osogbo, a South-Western city in Nigeria. The study classified neighbourhoods in the city into high-, medium-and low-density areas. Out of the 6 818 buildings identified in the selected neighbourhoods, multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 1 265 respondents. Using a survey research method, data were obtained through structured questionnaires, field observations, objective measurement of open spaces via Geographic Information System, and photographic recordings. The data were analysed with the aid of IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences Statistics 24, and further presented in descriptive statistics, percentage statistics, and chi-square test. Different typologies of open spaces were identified (school playgrounds, neighbourhood park, incidental open spaces, pocket park). Walking and vigorous, moderate, and sedentary activities were observed in the open spaces. Results also show that sedentary activities were prevalent across all typologies, and the highest proportion of vigorous activities occurred in the incidental open spaces. In addition, the results revealed statistically significant variations in self-reported vigorous outdoor activities across the open space typologies. There was also statistically significant difference in the level of activities between males and females in the city. Findings show that the patterns of outdoor activities differ by typologies. To stimulate active living, this study recommends that appropriate amenities be provided in urban open spaces.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
AB  - New York's Tompkins Square Park, a 10.5 acre public space on Manhattan's Lower East Side, has a long history of civil disorder, elaborated through public memory more than through actual fact. The park's conversion into a military drill ground for New York's wealthy and powerful Seventh Regiment in the years after the Civil War was driven by elite anxieties about protest and urban disorder that were amplified by growing class and ethnic hostilities and a changing social order. Despite the fact that park commissioners found other, more suitable locations for a drill ground site, state legislators with ties to Tammany Hall pushed through legislation that led to the park's destruction. But within 15 years, popular neighborhood protest would see the park restored to its original use as an urban gathering place and social center, a change that foretold an evolution in elite understanding of the uses of public space and the beginning of the city's Small Parks Movement.

AB  - Accessibility to parks and open spaces plays an important role in the urban quality of life. Public parks play a vital role that affects all members of society regardless of their social ranking. Accessibility (visitation) to parks and recreational areas has increased significantly all over the world. This scenario to some extent is the same in Hail city, where the area allocated for parks and open spaces is very small. Parks in Hail are still suffering from many planning and design aspects that discourage people from frequent visitations. This study, therefore, aims to address this phenomenon by examining the area allocated for parks and park attributes. The study's data are collected from the relevant literature regarding parks and their attributes. An assessment tool is designed and utilized to evaluate parks in Hail. Google maps software was used to measure the areas of neighborhoods and parks in addition to park distribution. This study shows that the areas allocated for parks are far below WHO requirements, and park attributes do not fully meet all visitors' requirements.

AU  - Abbey, S
T2  - LANDSCAPE JOURNAL
AB  - Ad hoc urbanism-activities performed in public space that fall outside of the officially sanctioned uses of that space-is usually met with regulations that attempt to control or criminalize the offending actions, which de Certeau (1984) has called "'waste products' of a functionalist administration" (p. 94). But unsanctioned improvisatory use patterns can convey information about what people require of their public places. Instead of dismissing these uses as undesirable and erasing them from public view, landscape architects can instead reframe them as justifications for expanding or altering programs to create public spaces that provide commons to a diverse citizenry for the purposes of living, regenerating com-munity, and asserting civic rights and responsibilities. Using news stories, case studies, and field observations, this article investigates examples of ad hoc urbanism to explore how landscape architects might accommodate their embedded meanings and expand the functionality and fairness of urban design.

T2  - SOCCER & SOCIETY
AB  - Employing conceptual considerations through the lens of the commons, this study explores the emergence and expansion of the self-organized Antifa sport clubs movement in crisis-stricken Greece. The analysis elaborates how groups of politicized fans found bottom-up Antifa sport clubs, implement practices of commoning and articulat a counter-discourse which give meaning to the football experience from the particular perspective of grassroots social movements. Antifa performative discourse offers a new articulation of dissenting political culture that attempt to undermine or reshape existing arrangements in modern football. Politicized fandom activity and protest in Greece is a sign of disaffection of many young people who experience labour market uncertainties and feel alienated from mainstream politics, reclaiming some control over their favourite game resisting neoliberal football order. Their counter-discourse offers an intriguing possibility of thinking about the experience of football club as a commons experimenting towards the collective re-appropriation of the 'game of the people'.

AB  - Pests of urban vegetation cause substantial aesthetic, economic and biodiversity damages, by weakening or completely destroying the plants. The recent climate changes, such as the excessive droughts alternating with heavy rain falls, and the significant imports of ornamental plants for urban landscape, as small parks, private gardens, and vertical walls, drastically increase the number of urban pests. These species are either newly introduced in the area, either they enlarge their host plant spectrum or increase their aggressiveness. We present the results of over a five-year period of monitoring of pests in the main city parks and private ornamental gardens in Bucharest. We detected 52 species of pests of urban vegetation. Each species locations and host plants are given. Eighteen of these species are alien to Romania: Cameraria ohridella on Aesculus hippocastanum, Cydalima perspectalis on Buxus spp., Unaspis euonymi on Euonymus sp., Corythucha ciliata and Phyllonorycter platani on Platanus sp., Corythucha arcuata on Quercus sp., Pseudaulacaspis pentagona on Syringa vulgaris and Morus alba, Adelges piceae on Picea sp., Adelges abietis on Abies sp., Adelges laricis on Larix sp., Macrosiphoniella sanborni on Chrysanthemum sp., Aphis spiraephaga on Spiraea x vanhouttei, Halyomorpha halys, Nezara viridula, Hyphantria cunea, Metcalfa pruinosa, Tetranychus urticae, and Trialeurodes vaporariorum on numerous ornamental species. Twelve of the alien species are considered invasive. More detailed information is presented for six of the most destructive species and a single case of interception for a mite not present in Europe.

AB  - Cities have suffered from urban heat island (UHI) effect due to rapid urbanization, which can be effectively adjusted by urban green space. Taking the community parks in central area of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province as an example, this paper explored the size and shape of small-scale parks to mitigate the UHI effect. Land surface temperature was retrieved from Landsat 8-OLI remote-sensing image of 2019. The 52 studied community parks were identified with ArcGIS 10.4, and classified by kernel building density. The threshold-size and optimal shape of community parks to mitigate UHI effect were then discussed. The results showed that 1) with the increase of buffer ring distance around the community parks, the cooling intensity decreased and the cooling extent were mostly less than 180 m; 2) the area, shape, and the NDVI of the parks were important factors affecting the cooling intensity; 3) the cooling intensity of community parks under a high kernel building density was better, with a higher threshold-size (0.848 hm(2)) than that of the low ones (0.384 hm(2)); and 4) the optimal cooling intensity would occur when the park in a shape of circle or square. In conclusion, it is suggested that small green space should be planned in the areas under a high building density. Through renewal design and refined management measures in the urban green space system planning, giving full play to the ecological benefits of urban green spaces in mitigating the local UHI effect can also be expected.

T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
AB  - Overabundant populations of kangaroos pose substantial management problems in small parks on the fringe of urban areas in Australia. Translocation is impractical and culling is often not publicly acceptable, but fertility control offers an acceptable alternative. One potential contraceptive is levonorgestrel, which provides effective long-term contraception in women, and prevents births in some marsupials for up to five years. We evaluated the long-term efficacy of levonorgestrel in free-ranging eastern grey kangaroos (M. giganteus) at two sites in Victoria, Australia. We trapped 25 adult females at one site (Portland Aluminium), treating 18 with two subcutaneous 70-mg levonorgestrel implants and seven with control (inert) implants. We darted 25 adult females at the other site (Woodlands Historic Park), treating all with two 70-mg levonorgestrel implants. We monitored the reproductive status of the kangaroos, as indicated by the obvious presence of a pouch young, in spring each year for up to seven years. In the first three years at Portland, 81-86% of levonorgestrel-treated females were infertile, compared with 12 - 29% in the control group, but the effectiveness of fertility control declined over time. At this site, the proportions of treated females breeding in the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh years of the trial were 36%, 50%, 67% and 100% respectively. Fecundity at Woodlands was similar. Although this protocol achieved fertility control for several years, it was likely that more than one treatment or a higher dose rate would be required for effective fertility control in this long-lived species.

AU  - Maynard, S
T2  - LAW AND HISTORY REVIEW
AB  - Just a stone's throw from the campus of the university in Kingston, Ontario, where I teach, is a small park. Hugging a rocky stretch of Lake Ontario shoreline, Macdonald Park, named after Canada's first prime minister, is better known by locals as "Pervert Park." Since at least World War II, Pervert Park has been the primary cruising ground in Kingston for men searching for sex with other men, a meeting place for a mix of mostly working-class men, men stationed at the nearby military base, and the occasional intrepid university student. For women, the park's name references a different kind of pervert and signals the potential danger of walking alone in the park at night. Two of the park's main features are the Newlands Pavilion, a bandstand built in 1896, and the Richardson bathhouse, which is really a public washroom and changing facility, and which, when it first opened in 1919, boasted lockers, hot-water showers, and a list of "rules that would be enforced to maintain decorum in the bathing house." A paved path, punctuated by park benches, connects the pavilion and bathhouse, which, after dark, conveniently becomes an oval track for men cruising around and sometimes having sex behind the pavilion and bathhouse.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Much research shows that urban parks can benefit human health. Research has shown that perceptions of park environments are an important determinant of park usage. Most perception-based research collects data through costly and time-consuming survey approaches, which limits data collection on a large scale. Google Street View (GSV) imagery presents a cost-effective source for deriving perceptions of the park environment: for large parks, GSV images are available on both peripheral roads and internal roads; for small parks, majorly covered by grassland, GSV images on peripheral roads can capture their general built environment. Additionally, the available Global Positioning System (GPS) incorporated into cellular phones enables researchers to measure how long people stay in parks conveniently by checking the time of the first and last GPS points in a park. Taking Chicago as the case study, this research introduces GSV images and the SafeGraph phone-based GPS dataset to study the association between perceptions of park environments and time spent in parks, which is rarely explored by previous studies. We derive both perceived safety and beauty of park environments using GSV images in 2018 and machine-learning Support Vector Machine models trained by a crowdsourcing dataset on human perception of environments. Time spent in each park is obtained from SafeGraph data in 2018. We build negative binomial regression models to explore the relationship between perception variables and time spent in parks. Results show that higher levels of both perceived safety and beauty are positively associated with increased time, and adding perception variables can improve the model performance. It benefits urban planners in designing a better park environment in support of park usage.

TI  - Urban hacking: the versatile forms of cultural resilience in Hong Kong
AU  - Valjakka, M
T2  - URBAN DESIGN INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The current understanding of urban resilience focuses on economic, environmental, and social responses. While the significance of art in enhancing social resistance has been acknowledged, the full potential of (un)authorised artistic and creative practices in initiating and strengthening the strategies of urban resilience is not yet recognised. Based on extensive fieldwork in 2012-2017, this paper delineates how urban hacking challenges the sociopolitical and spatio-aesthetic dynamics of the urban public space in Hong Kong as a form of cultural resilience that can contribute to a more holistic understanding of urban resilience. The diversity of urban hacking is indicated in an analysis of selected case studies of urban knitting and digital hacking that question the prevailing perceptions emphasising hacking as a method of illegal and arbitrary destruction. I posit that varied forms of urban hacking have a growing power to raise awareness of sociopolitical issues, enhance solidarity, and renegotiate space for new strategies and subjectivities aiming for more versatile co-authorship of the city.

AB  - Community parks provide urban residents with open spaces for daily recreation and physical fitness activities. This study aims to investigate visitor activity patterns in urban parks and the relationship between urban park features and spatial vitality through the field observation of three community parks in the old town area of Zhengzhou City. Spatial vitality refers to the inclusiveness, aggregation density, and use intensity of urban park space, which is quantified by the weighted average of four indicators (diversity of age group, visitor density, space using intensity and richness of activity types). A questionnaire survey was used to determine the key factors associated with park spatial vitality and visitors' needs in the park space. The results showed that the spatial vitality of each park varies across time and space; in addition, spatial vitality was influenced by the location of and the facilities in the park. The overall number of visitors of the parks was significantly higher on weekends than on weekdays, with the peak times of vitality being 10:00 am and 4:00 pm during the day. The results also revealed that children, middle-aged adults, and the elderly were the primary users of the community parks, and spatial preferences differed by age group. Moreover, certain locations (sandpits, squares, watersides, and kiosks for painting activities) and sites with more service facilities inside the parks had a higher spatial vitality. Furthermore, the spatial vitality of the park was not directly proportional to its size and visitor number. To increase urban park vitality, factors that need to be considered include location and size of park, demographic structure of the surrounding population, the facilities in the park, and open lawn space. In a high-density urban area, smaller parks must be planned to improve the service efficiency of urban parks. The results of this study can provide a reference point for urban park planning and design.

AB  - Amboseli is a small park located in the wildlife rich area of Tsavo-Amboseli Ecosystem in Southern Kenya. It is one of the leading parks in terms of absolute tourism revenue generated per year and one of the highest in terms of tourism revenue per unit conservation area. Its revenue is sometimes in excess of Ksh. 100 Million (US$1.33 Million) per year. However, as important as this park is to national and local economy, it has many challenges to its viability in terms of balancing conservation and tourism interests. Several reasons explain this. Its gazettement as a national park in 1974 did not carefully consider implications for the small size in light of its critical role as a dry season wildlife refuge. It is only a fragment of a formerly larger ecosystem, which has now been taken over by human settlement and other incompatible land uses to wildlife conservation. With mainly tourism revenue as a motivation, the government displaced the Maasai from the park and promised to provide them with water from Amboseli swamps or they could water their livestock in the park if this agreement failed. This historical agreement together with rising elephant population, increasing management and tourism infrastructure in the park, the contraction and land use changes in Amboseli Maasai dispersal areas and combine to make Amboseli National Park an increasingly unsustainable conservation unit. This paper discusses the dilemma of managing Amboseli for biodiversity conservation and as a popular tourist destination.

TI  - PARKLET IDEAS MAKING SMALL STREET URBAN SPACES WITH BIG IMPACTS
AU  - Shokry, HM
T2  - INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT & APPLIED SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - This paper discusses parklets, an idea of simple solutions that can solve some social issues and respond to environmental conditions, at the same time. The study approaches both theoretical and case study to represents an innovative approach to street design that redistributes street spaces more safe and comfortable for all users and, covers elements that can help to create friendly places to enhance community life. We can define parklets as, small removable, physical intervention platforms made available to the public for recreational use that takes the place of two or more on-street parking spaces, widening the sidewalk. Parklets symbolize the desire to create a more enjoyable, communal, healthy, and vibrant public realm. Transforming excess street space into a cost-effective, small park that can have an enormous impact. Designing a successful parklet requires a variety of considerations. The study shows that small spaces can make a massive difference on the street by creating new public spaces and pedestrian areas that improve the quality of life. After reviewing and analyzing many models of parklets in the world, the paper reaches some standards of parklets design, which can correspond to the streets of downtown Jazan City as a case study that can be applied in all cities of the Saudi Kingdom and the world.

TI  - Grassroots temporary urbanism as a challenge to the city of austerity? Lessons from a self-organised park in Thessaloniki, Greece
AU  - Kapsali, M
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
AB  - This paper traces the legacies of austerity through a focus on grassroots temporary urban interventions in public spaces. Drawing on a self-organised neighbourhood park in Thessaloniki, Greece, it explores and analyses the politicising dynamics of these urban experiments that emerged as a direct response to state retrenchment but became a long-term legacy of austerity with material and social consequences. The aim of the paper is to contribute to contemporary scholarly debates on temporary grassroots urbanism amidst austerity by uncovering the ambiguous nature of such urban experiments without reproducing dichotomising approaches that understand them as either a vehicle of neoliberalisation or an instrument of revolt. Through the case of Svolou I develop a twofold argument. First, regarding their social dynamics and legacies, grassroots urban initiatives that lack a politicising element of disagreement with (planning and governance) authorities result in creating parallel micro-spheres of socialities and solidarities with a questionable long-term impact against austerity urbanism. Although such socialities are important at the local level, they often risk reproducing neoliberal rationalities of individual responsibility and exclusions. Second, regarding their material legacies, I argue that grassroots urban initiatives produce temporary self-organised spaces and experiment with innovative grassroots space-making processes but they often remain entrapped at the local level without being able to develop broader contestations of the uneven urban development model emerging in and through austerity.

AU  - Plevoets, B

T2  - CITIES
AB  - Over the past few decades, the adaptive reuse of buildings-transforming them to meet new functional and aesthetic needs and requirements-has become a highly specialized domain within architectural and conservation practice, and is becoming a field of scholarly study in its own right. However, in juxtaposition with this highly specialized practice, people reuse and adapt all sorts of buildings in spontaneous and informal ways in a process we call "vernacular adaptation." This paper investigates such vernacular adaptation of built heritage, along with its specific characteristics, opportunities, and threats as well as its influence on more formal adaptive reuse practice. As methodology, we examine relevant literature to review historical and contemporary examples of vernacular adaptation and reuse. In conclusion, we present the vernacular approach as a valuable alternative to the "formal" or specialized, top-down method to managing existing built environment, especially for buildings and sites that possess compelling social value. Moreover, our study indicates that in practice, the division between the vernacular and the formal is not rigid, elaborating on the possibilities and risks of joined initiatives between local communities and private or public developers.

AB  - Harperella (Harperella nodosum) is a federally endangered plant with 26 known sites in the southeastern United States. Experiments in the greenhouse and observations in the wild demonstrated that harperella is an annual plant and its seeds can germinate immediately after seed maturation under warm-weather conditions in late summer. Harperella was observed to utilize two complementary reproductive strategies as important adaptations to survival in a frequently flooded, semiaquatic habitat, depending on flooding frequency and amplitude: (a) sexual reproduction during low-water years involving flowering and seed production and (b) asexual reproduction during high-water years involving viability of ramets produced at the nodes.

AB  - The theories of Henri Lefebvre on the Production of Space have been influential to our understanding of the ontology of space. This paper complements work which draws on Lefebvre but extends its benefit for planning research through a dialogue with the philosophy of Jacques Ranciere. Specifically, the paper formulates a novel investigative framework for examining the micropolitics of the production of space by integrating the work of these philosophers. The analytical benefits of this approach for planning research are illustrated through its application to a case study of community gardening in Dublin, Ireland.

TI  - Environmental rehabilitation of the formal city: The case of Rio das Pedras in Rio de Janeiro
AU  - Mazarro, AD
T2  - MATERIA ARQUITECTURA
AB  - This article explores the notion of "value" that lies beneath architectural preservation in order to establish a relationship between cultural and environmental values of the built heritage. To illustrate this case, an analysis has been done of the physical, social and environmental drama of the community of Rio das Pedras in Rio de Janeiro, adjacent to a lagoon where sewage flows from formal areas as well as informal settlements. Even though as a physical fact this informal settlement is a counter-image of the city architecture, the environmental load received by the urban environment is mostly produced by the formal neighbourhood next to Barra de Tijuca.
The rehabilitation of informal settlements is nowadays a marginal topic as an architectural issue, even though it is not so for other disciplines. The physical or material maintenance of buildings is relevant as a construction question: structurally, they must be stable and have sufficient infrastructure and space. At an urban level, material preservation of informal settlements - in this article also called "slums", "favelas" or "barrios" depending on the context - has to do with the geological and topographic conditions (that they are not in areas of risk or polluted) and the legal aspects (that they do not violate rights of property or land use).
Beyond its physical consideration, the social entity which the informal settlement is, too, is protected by the "right to the city" that countries increasingly apply to urban regulations. This right emphasises the social nature of private property and, with this it privileges the right of its residents to constitute the city by living in it and using it, beyond interests that intend to obtain an individual economic benefit from the land. Exceptionally, some informal settlements like the favela in Morro da Providencia, in the heart of the historic centre of Rio de Janeiro and with a history of over a century, acquire, in addition, a cultural value that serves as an argument to consider them as heritage and thus preserve their physical structure and protect their cultural substratum.
But, as a built form, as an architectural matter, informal settlements are not usually acknowledged as architectural heritage of the cities. Slums are, in fact, the counter-image of architecture: they do not comply with basic urban, construction and health standards and, what is more important, they are built without a previous plan. This double state degrades its "architectural projects" to mere "constructions" and creates the generally accepted antithesis that slums are averse to the city. Even well intentioned projects of urban improvement recently developed, underline this antithesis: from the "Cities without Slums" initiative of the United Nations, to the urban acupuncture projects of Giancarlo Mazzanti in Medellin or of Urban-Think Tank in Caracas. These initiatives reify a protomodern view of heritage: that of the cultural "object" in front of the popular "fact". Architecturally speaking, slums are the children of a lesser God.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey's Gap Analysis Program (hereafter, GAP) is a nationally based program that uses land cover, vertebrate distributions, and land ownership to identify locations where gaps in conservation coverage exist, and GAP products are commonly used by government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and private citizens. The GAP land-cover designations are based on satellite-derived data, and although these data are widely available, these data do not capture the 3-dimensional vegetation architecture that may be important in describing vertebrate distributions. To date, no studies have examined how the inclusion of snag-or shrub-specific Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data might influence GAP model performance. The objectives of this paper were 1) to assess the performance of the National GAP models and Northwest GAP models with independently collected field data, and 2) to assess whether the inclusion of 3-dimensional vegetation data from LiDAR improved the performance of National GAP and Northwest GAP models. We included only two parameters from the LiDAR data: presence or absence of shrubs and presence or absence of snags >= 25 cm diameter at breast height. We surveyed for birds at >150 points in a 20,000-ha coniferous forest in northern Idaho and used data for eight shrub-and cavity-nesting species for validation purposes. On a guild level, National GAP models performed only marginally better than Northwest GAP models in correct classification rate, and LiDAR data did not improve vertebrate distribution models. At the scale used in this study, GAP models had poor predictive power and this is important for managers interested in using GAP models for species distributions at scales similar to ours, such as a small park or preserve,200 km(2) in size. Additionally, because the inclusion of LiDAR data did not consistently affect the performance of GAP models, future studies might consider whether LiDAR data affect GAP model performance by examining 1) different spatial scales, 2) different LiDAR metrics, and/or 3) species-specific habitat relationships not currently available in GAP models.

AU  - Chassin, T
AU  - Ingensand, J
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VIRTUAL REALITY
AB  - Typical urban participatory approaches engage citizens through lengthy sessions far from the area under transformation by an urban project. Several issues result from these settings of involvement including the mobilization of similar individuals, overwhelming participatory codes, or a gap between the affected urban landscape and the location of the session. This study introduces a modern approach that leverages the use of 3D web applications to address some of the critical challenges of popular participatory sessions. The developed approach, named e-guerrilla 3D participation, is based on five dimensions: immediate participation, ease of use, flexibility, place-based engagement, and immersivity. A prototype complying with these five dimensions was implemented in this study. The prototype promotes an in situ engagement where all the users (without distinction) of a public area can explore a future urban project and get involved within minutes. A usability study conducted with 26 expert and non-expert participants investigated the prototype through a fictive scenario. The findings demonstrate a positive outcome in terms of participatory results that are identifiable with the prototype (highlighting the controversial elements of the projects) and encourage feedback collected during a survey and interview. The usability study suggests key aspects that should be considered to improve the design of participatory sessions and their interactive mediums (or tools), such as realism, affordance, incentive, and purpose. The promising participatory approach (and prototype), which was unpacked step-by-step in this study, does not replace typical practices but could help to complement them by reaching a non-selected and broader public; hence leading to the design of more inclusive participatory approaches.

T2  - CITIES
AB  - Small-scale public spaces in old city zones are important places for seniors to participate in city life and can often be neglected. Street-corner small-scale public spaces are fairly typical in this case. This study randomly selected 74 street-corner small-scale public spaces in Tianjin, China as sample spaces, and the daily behaviors of seniors were continuously observed and periodically photographed for data collection. The duration of observation for each sample space was no less than 4 h. Based on the extraction of the collected data, the characteristics of seniors' behaviors in terms of the percentage and frequency of occurrence were quantitatively analyzed. Subsequently, combined with the data of the spatial form indexes, using communication as an example, the impact of spatial form on the frequency of occurrence for seniors' behaviors were explored. It was found that the width of the adjacent street, the average height of surrounding buildings, the number of seats, and the average noise level have statistically significant impacts on the frequency of seniors' communication. This study will provide a significant basis with scientific evidence and quantitative method to urban designers and policy makers for the urban age-friendly regeneration of small-scale public spaces in old city zones.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB  - How much can greenery cool a city remains inconclusive in literature, especially in a high-density city where plants interact with anthropogenic heat from surrounding buildings and traffic. A novel simulation model, the Urban Greenery and Built Environment, was developed to assess the time-varying interactions between plants and anthropogenic heat at street scale. The model has been evaluated using field studies in two parks in Hong Kong. A reasonably good agreement was observed between measured and predicted temperature and humidity. Sensitivity studies were then conducted to compare the cooling performances of greenery in five scenarios under various coverage ratio and climates. By covering 40% of site with greenery, a practical limit, the expected air temperature and UTCI reductions were 0.3 degrees C, lower than previous estimates due to limited sunlight and groundlevel surfaces for planting; the cooling benefits of greenery were predicted to be higher in dry climates and lower in humid ones. In a high-density city, plants converted sensible heat into latent gains at a slower rate than the anthropogenic exhaust heat. Alternative strategies, such as breeze enhancement, water-spray and management of anthropogenic heat discharges were predicted to further help to cool the city by 3.1 degrees C, 6.8 degrees C, and 1.8 degrees C, respectively.

AB  - Urban community parks have significant benefits for city residents, both physical and spiritual. This is especially true in developing countries, such as China. The purpose of our study is to describe the current situation of the community parks in five main districts of Jinan City while recognizing features of the community parks that influence usage patterns. Our study also means to determine the desired improvements of visitors that promote access to and use of community parks on the basis of the Chinese context. We conducted a survey among 542 community park visitors and obtained valid responses. The findings of respondents show that community parks are mostly used by people over 55 years (34.7%) and children under 10 years (23.6%). The main motives for using community parks are for exercise (24.2%) and to socialize with others (21.6%). The majority of respondents (65.7%) rated the community park as satisfactory and considered only a few improvements needed. Regarding the desired improvements, numerous respondents mentioned adding more physical training facilities (13.3%) and activity areas (7.6%), as well as emergency call buttons in areas frequented by children and older people (7.6%). Furthermore, most of the respondents (79.9%) indicated that they would like to use the community parks more frequently if there is additional progress to make the parks more attractive, cleaner, and friendlier. These results can help park designers, government agencies, and community groups to provide the planning and design strategies for community parks to promote their upgrading in China.

AB  - Urbanization models that do not comply with the planning criteria are affecting human lives. In urban areas, street trees have positive contributions to the ecosystem and human thermal comfort. In this study, the thermal comfort of the main streets that connect people to each other and provide access and transportation has been thermally explored. Cumhuriyet Street, which is one of the vibrant streets in Erzurum, was selected as a case study scenario in the winter and summer periods in 2018 by using the ENVI-met V. 4.4.2 winter model. A different green scenario is proposed, and the best thermal comfort scenario in both seasons is determined. The results show that, in the summer period, the air temperature of the greener street scenario is about 1.0 degrees C cooler than the existing condition and about 2.0 degrees C warmer in the winter period. Physiological equivalent temperature (PET) value was better in narrow canyon streets in winter months, but in wide canyon streets in summer months. The green scenarios of wide canyon streets positively affect the outdoor thermal comfort in both seasons. These results clearly imply that green streets are an appropriate strategy for city streets that suffer from discomfort levels in cold winter and hot summer periods. It has been concluded that it is possible to increase thermal comfort through improvement in the open space in street and more suitable plant preferences for livable urbanization. Planning streets in a new city characterized by summer and winter seasons should take into consideration an accurate decision for providing a thermal comfort level and healthy urbanization.

T2  - LAND
AB  - White-collar workers, with tremendous work pressure, excessive working hours, and poor physical condition, need green spaces not only to have physical exercise and social gatherings, but also to become closer to nature and to relieve stress for their mental health. In China, the 996 office schedule, working from 09:00 to 17:00 six days a week, has become popular in the workplace; under such high-intensity work and pressure, white-collar workers have limited time to access green space for leisure, and their use of green space for health benefits is compromised. This study selected Shenzhen Futian Central Business District to find out the green space use patterns and preferences of white-collar workers based on GPS data and questionnaire surveys. In addition, the value of green exposure in the time dimension was calculated according to individuals' actual behaviors. Based on cluster analysis, this study summarized the typical green space use patterns of three groups of white-collar workers, which reflects the hidden inequity of white-collar groups who are subjected to varying degrees of spatiotemporal constraints in using green space. This paper puts forward three directions for the optimization of green space allocation, functional facilities, and improved walkability in employment-intensive urban areas. The results provide certain guiding significance for alleviating the mismatch of time and space in green space enjoyment and for improving the spatiotemporal inclusiveness of green spaces in urban central business districts.

T2  - ENERGY
AB  - By coupling multiple energy networks, an integrated energy system can realize the conversion and complementarity of various energy sources. The development of regional integrated energy systems (RIESs) has brought both opportunities and challenges to the energy market. Without a reasonable integrated energy day-ahead trading structure, it is difficult for energy providers to make profits and for consumers to achieve economic energy utilization. At the same time, various user-side energy loads are controllable, and it is necessary to comprehensively consider multi-energy demand responses in energy trading and management. To address the above issues, the trading behaviors of main market players are clarified, and an integrated energy pricing and management strategy is proposed in this paper. Multi energy demand response models for data centers, electric vehicles (EVs) and air conditioning loads (ACLs) are also established. Considering multi-energy demand responses, a day-ahead energy pricing and management model for RIESs is proposed. The model is a bilevel Stackelberg game optimization model, in which the upper level considers profit maximization of energy service provider (ESP) while the lower level deals with the cost minimization of energy consumer (EC). Based on simulation analysis, the feasibility of the proposed model is verified. The trading scheme optimized by this model can benefit both ESP and EC. Compared with a traditional integrated energy trading structure, the profit source of ESP is enlarged. The simulation results also show that the application of multi-energy demand responses can improve the economic and collaborative operation effect of RIESs and reduce carbon emissions.

T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The concern of mitigating thermal stress and pollutant concentration has increased in recent urban design. Most previous studies have demonstrated the promising potential of integrating building setbacks to simultaneously improve thermal comfort and air quality within street canyons. By conducting computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations with the consideration of solar radiation, the effects of both horizontal and vertical building setbacks on outdoor thermal comfort and air quality are simultaneously investigated inside the low-rise and high-rise street canyon. Several design parameters of building setbacks are considered, i.e., the dimensionless height (H-HS/W) and dimensionless width (D-HS/W) for the horizontal setbacks (HS), as well as the dimensionless length (L-VS/L) and dimensionless width (D-VS/W) for the vertical setbacks (VS), where W and L are the street width and length. The results demonstrate that the horizontal building setbacks are advocated within the low-rise street canyon, which simultaneously improves the thermal comfort and air quality. By manipulating its dimensionless vertical cross-section area SHS (increasing S-HS = H-HS/W x D-HS/W) and its dimensionless aspect ratio H-HS/D-HS (lowering HHS/DHS), the average PET can decline by up to 2.1 C and the average pollutant concentration can reduce by up to 61% at the two-side pedestrian level (windward and leeward sides). The vertical building set-backs are more suitable for the high-rise street canyon to create better outdoor environments. The dimensionless horizontal cross-section area SVS (= L-VS/L x D-VS/W) should be as large as possible so that the average PET can decrease by up to 0.7 C and the average pollutant concentration can reduce by up to 35% at the two-side pedestrian level. Finally, an effectiveness index to simultaneously evaluate thermal comfort and air quality is introduced and proves effective.

AB  - Predation critically threatens reproductive success of sea turtles and shorebirds at many of Florida's beaches. We examined the biological and bioeconomic results of predator management on two adjacent barrier islands, Cayo Costa and North Captiva, along Florida's west coast. Both islands suffered severe nesting losses due to predation and disturbance due to raccoons, while Cayo Costa also was impacted by a large population of feral swine. In 2006, our initial year of study, neither island received predator management and no least tern production occurred on either island, and sea turtle nest predation was 74% and 60%, respectively, for Cayo Costa and North Captiva. Predators were managed in 2007 on Cayo Costa while North Captiva served as an untreated reference island. North Captiva again had no least tern production and sea turtle nest predation was 84%. In contrast, Cayo Costa produced 31 least terns and sea turtle nest predation plummeted to 16%. Both islands received predator management in 2008 when Cayo Costa and North Captiva respectively produced 20 and 55 least terns and had 15% and 0% sea turtle nest predation. The entire costs for predator management by experts over the course of the study was $USD 39,636, while the returns in additional production of least tern young and hatchling sea turtles was valued over $USD 1.1 million for a resulting benefit-cost ratio of 27.8.

AB  - A laccase-producing ascomycete fungus was isolated from soil collected around the premises of a textile dye factory and identified as Nectriella pironii. Efficient laccase production was achieved via the synergistic action of 1 mM copper sulfate and ferulic acid. Extracts of rapeseed oil cake, grass hay, and leaf litter collected in a pocket urban park were used for enzyme production. The highest laccase activity (3,330 U/L) was observed in the culture grown on the leaf litter extract. This is the first report on biosynthesis of laccase by N. pironii. This is also the first study on utilization of naturally fallen park leaves as a substrate for fungal laccase production. The extracellular enzyme possessing laccase activity was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatographic techniques. The amino acid sequence of the protein revealed highest similarity to the laccase enzyme produced by Stachybotrys chartarum-and considerable homology to those produced by other fungal species. The purified laccase possessed a molecular mass of 50 kDa. The enzyme had an optimum pH of 2.0 or 6.0 and retained more than 50% of residual activity after 3 hours of incubation at pH 3.0-10.6 or 4.0-9.0 when 2,20-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid or 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, respectively, were used. Dithiothreitol, beta-mercaptoethanol, and sodium azide at 1 mM concentration strongly inhibited the laccase activity, while in the presence of 50 mM urea, the enzyme was found to retain 25% of its activity. The laccase was able to decolorize more than 80% of Indigo Carmine, Remazol Brilliant Blue R, Reactive Orange 16, and Acid Red 27 dyes within 1 h. The possibility of leaf litter use for the production of the laccase enzyme from N. pironii (IM 6443), exhibiting high pH stability and degradative potential, makes it a promising tool for use in different environmental and industrial operations.
